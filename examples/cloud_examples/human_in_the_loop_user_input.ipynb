    "# How to Wait for User Input\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main human-in-the-loop interaction patterns is waiting for human input. A key use case involves asking the user clarifying questions. One way to accomplish this is simply go to the `END` node and exit the graph. Then, any user response comes back in as fresh invocation of the graph. This is basically just creating a chatbot architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue with this is it is tough to resume back in a particular point in the graph. Often times the agent is halfway through some process, and just needs a bit of a user input. Although it is possible to design your graph in such a way where you have a `conditional_entry_point` to route user messages back to the right place, that is not super scalable (as it essentially involves having a routing function that can end up almost anywhere).\n",
    "\n",
    "A separate way to do this is to have a node explicitly for getting user input. This is easy to implement in a notebook setting - you just put an `input()` call in the node. But that isn't exactly production ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, LangGraph makes it possible to do similar things in a production way. The basic idea is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set up a node that represents human input. This can have specific incoming/outgoing edges (as you desire). There shouldn't actually be any logic inside this node.\n",
    "- Add a breakpoint before the node. This will stop the graph before this node executes (which is good, because there's no real logic in it anyways)\n",
    "- Use `.update_state` to update the state of the graph. Pass in whatever human response you get. The key here is to use the `as_node` parameter to apply this update **as if you were that node**. This will have the effect of making it so that when you resume execution next it resumes as if that node just acted, and not from the beginning."
