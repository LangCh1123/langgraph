    "# How to view and update past graph state\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you start [checkpointing](../persistence.ipynb) your graphs, you can easily **get** or **update** the state of the agent at any point in time. This permits a few things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can surface a state during an interrupt to a user to let them accept an action.\n",
    "2. You can **rewind** the graph to reproduce or avoid issues.\n",
    "3. You can **modify** the state to embed your agent into a larger system, or to let the user better control its actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key methods used for this functionality are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [get_state](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/graphs/#langgraph.graph.graph.CompiledGraph.get_state): fetch the values from the target config\n",
    "- [update_state](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/graphs/#langgraph.graph.graph.CompiledGraph.update_state): apply the given values to the target state\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** this requires passing in a checkpointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a quick example."
