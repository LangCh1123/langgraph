    "# Reasoning without Observation\n",
    "\n",
    "In [ReWOO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18323), Xu, et. al, propose an agent that combines a multi-step planner and variable substitution for effective tool use. It was designed to improve on the ReACT-style agent architecture in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reduce token consumption and execution time by generating the full chain of tools used in a single pass. (_ReACT-style agent architecture requires many LLM calls with redundant prefixes (since the system prompt and previous steps are provided to the LLM for each reasoning step_)\n",
    "2. Simplify the fine-tuning process. Since the planning data doesn't depend on the outputs of the tool, models can be fine-tuned without actually invoking the tools (in theory).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following diagram outlines ReWOO's overall computation graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "![ReWoo Diagram](./img/rewoo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "ReWOO is made of 3 modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ðŸ§ **Planner**: Generate the plan in the following format:\n",
    "```text\n",
    "Plan: <reasoning>\n",
    "#E1 = Tool[argument for tool]\n",
    "Plan: <reasoning>\n",
    "#E2 = Tool[argument for tool with #E1 variable substitution]\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. **Worker**: executes the tool with the provided arguments.\n",
    "4. ðŸ§ **Solver**: generates the answer for the initial task based on the tool observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modules with a ðŸ§  emoji depend on an LLM call. Notice that we avoid redundant calls to the planner LLM by using variable substitution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, each module is represented by a LangGraph node. The end result will leave a trace that looks [like this one](https://smith.langchain.com/public/39dbdcf8-fbcc-4479-8e28-15377ca5e653/r). Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## 0. Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we will provide the agent with a Tavily search engine tool. You can get an API key [here](https://app.tavily.com/sign-in) or replace with a free tool option (e.g., [duck duck go search](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/ddg)).\n",

He gets a second serve at which to go, goes to Sinnerâ€™s forehand â€“ thatâ€™s the second time heâ€™s done that, and heâ€™s trying to play aggressively â€“ a long rally ensures â€¦ and again, a little imprecision, Sinner going long, means three break points. He wins a rally from the back when Medvedev nets, but is then directed about the court, a surprise forehand to the corner altering the flow of the next point with a backhand cleaning up for 15-all, then two service winners in a row making 40-15. Again, he misses a first serve on deuce, Medvedev able to dominate the point, and this time offered a volley for a break, he snaps it away, and frankly Iâ€™m in awe of what weâ€™re seeing here from one of the great competitors and strategists in all sport. Heâ€™ll be desperate to get Sinner back under pressure with as quick a hold as possible and does, to love; Sinner needs to find a different way, perhaps using more slice and coming to the net more, because currently, heâ€™s getting a going-over.\\\\n\\'}, {\\'url\\': \\'https://tennisuptodate.com/atp/match-report-2024-australian-open-jannik-sinner-wins-maiden-grand-slam-title-in-scintillating-comeback-win-over-daniil-medvedev\\', \\'content\\': \\'Neither could penetrate each others serve in the third as Medvedev looked for a sneaky opportunity to head towards claiming the title that wasnâ€™t forthcoming as despite chipping away at the Sinner serve in the back end of the set, he went 5-4 up and the impossible was on if he could break the Russianâ€™s serve to seal the set.\\\\n It is sheer joy and elation for Jannik Sinner, but heartbreak for Daniil Medvedev as the Italian ace has sealed a maiden Grand Slam claiming the 2024 Australian Open in stunning style winning it 3-6, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-3.\\\\nAnointed as the king of tennis after beating Djokovic at the ATP Finals by Italian media, they will be beside themselves this time around as Sinner who many quipped about his potential to win Grand Slams over the fellow Next Gen in Carlos Alcaraz and Holger Rune continues his epic run as of late to win a maiden crown.\\\\n But for Medvedev, it is shades of the 2019 US Open final as he went two sets up in this case against Sinner, but the all or nothing mentality seemed to be the decisive nail in the coffin as he looked more and more exhausted and Sinner on the other hand revived himself to terrific effect to take each of the next three sets on decisive breaks when it mattered most. But he was forced to play a fourth with Sinner having the serve to send it towards a decider at 2-1.\\\\nTo begin the fourth, Medvedev started brightly but Sinner held serve at 2-1 and Medvedev had the trainer come out to look at his right foot. He broke again at 5-1 to go to the brink of a two set lead, but Sinner grew into the match and prolonged the set as it looked suddenly like it couldâ€™ve gone back on serve but vitally, Medvedev saved break points and took his set point finally to go two up.\\'}, {\\'url\\': \\'https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/68120937\\', \\'content\\': \\'Live scores, results and order of play\\\\nAlerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone\\\\nRelated Topics\\\\nTop Stories\\\\nFA Cup: Blackburn Rovers v Wrexham - live text commentary\\\\nRussian skater Valieva given four-year ban for doping\\\\nLinks to Barcelona are \\\\\\'totally untrue\\\\\\' - Arteta\\\\nElsewhere on the BBC\\\\nThe truth behind the fake grooming scandal\\\\nFeaturing unseen police footage and interviews with the officers at the heart of the case\\\\nDid their father and uncle kill Nazi war criminals?\\\\n A real-life murder mystery following three brothers in their quest for the truth\\\\nWhat was it like to travel on the fastest plane?\\\\nTake a behind-the-scenes look at the supersonic story of the Concorde\\\\nToxic love, ruthless ambition and shocking betrayal\\\\nTell Me Lies follows a passionate college relationship with unimaginable consequences...\\\\n \"\\\\nMarathon man Medvedev runs out of steam\\\\nMedvedev is the first player to lose two Grand Slam finals after winning the opening two sets\\\\nSo many players with the experience of a Grand Slam final have talked about how different the occasion can be, particularly if it is the first time, and potentially overwhelming.\\\\n Jannik Sinner beats Daniil Medvedev in Melbourne final\\\\nJannik Sinner is the youngest player to win the Australian Open men\\\\\\'s title since Novak Djokovic in 2008\\\\nJannik Sinner landed the Grand Slam title he has long promised with an extraordinary fightback to beat Daniil Medvedev in the Australian Open final.\\\\n \"\\\\nSinner starts 2024 in inspired form\\\\nSinner won the first Australian Open men\\\\\\'s final since 2005 which did not feature Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal or Novak Djokovic\\\\nSinner was brought to the forefront of conversation when discussing Grand Slam champions in 2024 following a stunning end to last season.\\\\n\\'}]', '#E2': \"content='I am sorry, but I cannot provide real-time information as I am an AI and do not have access to the internet.
