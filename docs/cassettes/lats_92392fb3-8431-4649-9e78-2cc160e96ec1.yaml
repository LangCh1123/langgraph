        clashes with previous studies that found a very rapid radiation of avian orders
        only after the K-Pg extinction.[17][18] The results of this study have been
        disputed by other researchers, due to a lack of fossil evidence to support
        its conclusions.[19]\\nThe birds that survived the end-of-Cretaceous extinction
        were likely ground-dwelling (not arboreal) and thus persisted despite the
        worldwide destruction of forests.[20][21]\\nAn analysis of the variation of
        diversification rates through time further revealed a potential effect of
        climate on the evolution diversification rates in birds in which the generation
        of new lineages accelerates during periods of global cooling.[13] This can
        be the result of climate cooling fragmenting tropical biomes and producing
        widespread allopatric speciation plus an effect of some lineages diversifying
        in the expanding arid and cool biomes.[13]\\nBird skull evolution decelerated
        compared with the evolution of their dinosaur predecessors after the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene
        extinction event, rather than accelerating as often believed to have caused
        the cranial shape diversity of modern birds.[22][23]\\nClassification of modern
        species[edit]\\nThe phylogenetic classification of birds is a contentious
        issue. The skeleton of all early bird candidates is basically that of a small
        theropod dinosaur with long, clawed hands, though the exquisite preservation
        of the Solnhofen Plattenkalk shows Archaeopteryx was covered in feathers and
        had wings.[5] While Archaeopteryx and its relatives may not have been very
        good fliers, they would at least have been competent gliders, setting the
        stage for the evolution of life on the wing.\\n Phylogenetically, Aves is
        usually defined as all descendants of the most recent common ancestor of a
        specific modern bird species (such as the house sparrow, Passer domesticus),
        and either Archaeopteryx,[2] or some prehistoric species closer to Neornithes
        (to avoid the problems caused by the unclear relationships of Archaeopteryx
        to other theropods).[3] If the latter classification is used then the larger
        group is termed Avialae. The discoveries of further basal dromaeosaurids potentially
        capable of powered flight, such as Xiaotingia, has provided more evidence
        for the theory that flight was first developed in the bird line by early dromaeosaurids
        rather than later by Aves as was previously supposed.[8]\\nAlthough ornithischian
        (bird-hipped) dinosaurs share the same hip structure as birds, birds actually
        originated from the saurischian (lizard-hipped) dinosaurs if the dinosaurian

      extinction were likely ground-dwelling (not arboreal) and thus persisted despite
      the worldwide destruction of forests.[20][21]\\nAn analysis of the variation
      of diversification rates through time further revealed a potential effect of
      climate on the evolution diversification rates in birds in which the generation
      of new lineages accelerates during periods of global cooling.[13] This can be
      the result of climate cooling fragmenting tropical biomes and producing widespread
      allopatric speciation plus an effect of some lineages diversifying in the expanding
      arid and cool biomes.[13]\\nBird skull evolution decelerated compared with the
      evolution of their dinosaur predecessors after the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene
      extinction event, rather than accelerating as often believed to have caused
      the cranial shape diversity of modern birds.[22][23]\\nClassification of modern
      species[edit]\\nThe phylogenetic classification of birds is a contentious issue.
      The skeleton of all early bird candidates is basically that of a small theropod
      dinosaur with long, clawed hands, though the exquisite preservation of the Solnhofen
      Plattenkalk shows Archaeopteryx was covered in feathers and had wings.[5] While
      Archaeopteryx and its relatives may not have been very good fliers, they would
      at least have been competent gliders, setting the stage for the evolution of
      life on the wing.\\n Phylogenetically, Aves is usually defined as all descendants
      of the most recent common ancestor of a specific modern bird species (such as
      the house sparrow, Passer domesticus), and either Archaeopteryx,[2] or some
      prehistoric species closer to Neornithes (to avoid the problems caused by the
      unclear relationships of Archaeopteryx to other theropods).[3] If the latter
      classification is used then the larger group is termed Avialae. The discoveries
      of further basal dromaeosaurids potentially capable of powered flight, such
      as Xiaotingia, has provided more evidence for the theory that flight was first
      developed in the bird line by early dromaeosaurids rather than later by Aves
      as was previously supposed.[8]\\nAlthough ornithischian (bird-hipped) dinosaurs
      share the same hip structure as birds, birds actually originated from the saurischian
      (lizard-hipped) dinosaurs if the dinosaurian origin theory is correct.\"}, {\"url\":
