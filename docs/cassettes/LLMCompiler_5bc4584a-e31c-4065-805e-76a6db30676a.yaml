    body: '{"messages": [{"content": "Given a user query, create a plan to solve it
      with the utmost parallelizability. Each plan should comprise an action from
      the following 3 types:\n1. tavily_search_results_json(query=\"the search query\")
      - a search engine.\n\n2. math(problem: str, context: Optional[list[str]]) ->
      float:\n - Solves the provided math problem.\n - `problem` can be either a simple
      math problem (e.g. \"1 + 3\") or a word problem (e.g. \"how many apples are
      there if there are 3 apples and 2 apples\").\n - You cannot calculate multiple
      expressions in one call. For instance, `math(''1 + 3, 2 + 4'')` does not work.
      If you need to calculate multiple expressions, you need to call them separately
      like `math(''1 + 3'')` and then `math(''2 + 4'')`\n - Minimize the number of
      `math` actions as much as possible. For instance, instead of calling 2. math(\"what
      is the 10% of $1\") and then call 3. math(\"$1 + $2\"), you MUST call 2. math(\"what
      is the 110% of $1\") instead, which will reduce the number of math actions.\n
      - You can optionally provide a list of strings as `context` to help the agent
      solve the problem. If there are multiple contexts you need to answer the question,
      you can provide them as a list of strings.\n - `math` action will not see the
      output of the previous actions unless you provide it as `context`. You MUST
      provide the output of the previous actions as `context` if you need to do math
      on it.\n - You MUST NEVER provide `search` type action''s outputs as a variable
      in the `problem` argument. This is because `search` returns a text blob that
      contains the information about the entity, not a number or value. Therefore,
      when you need to provide an output of `search` action, you MUST provide it as
      a `context` argument to `math` action. For example, 1. search(\"Barack Obama\")
      and then 2. math(\"age of $1\") is NEVER allowed. Use 2. math(\"age of Barack
      Obama\", context=[\"$1\"]) instead.\n - When you ask a question about `context`,
      specify the units. For instance, \"what is xx in height?\" or \"what is xx in
      millions?\" instead of \"what is xx?\"\n\n3. join(): Collects and combines results
      from prior actions.\n\n - An LLM agent is called upon invoking join() to either
      finalize the user query or wait until the plans are executed.\n - join should
      always be the last action in the plan, and will be called in two scenarios:\n   (a)
      if the answer can be determined by gathering the outputs from tasks to generate
      the final response.\n   (b) if the answer cannot be determined in the planning
      phase before you execute the plans. Guidelines:\n - Each action described above
      contains input/output types and description.\n    - You must strictly adhere
      to the input and output types for each action.\n    - The action descriptions
      contain the guidelines. You MUST strictly follow those guidelines when you use
      the actions.\n - Each action in the plan should strictly be one of the above
      types. Follow the Python conventions for each action.\n - Each action MUST have
      a unique ID, which is strictly increasing.\n - Inputs for actions can either
      be constants or outputs from preceding actions. In the latter case, use the
      format $id to denote the ID of the previous action whose output will be the
      input.\n - Always call join as the last action in the plan. Say ''<END_OF_PLAN>''
      after you call join\n - Ensure the plan maximizes parallelizability.\n - Only
      use the provided action types. If a query cannot be addressed using these, invoke
      the join action for the next steps.\n - Never introduce new actions other than
      the ones provided.", "role": "system"}, {"content": "What''s the GDP of New
