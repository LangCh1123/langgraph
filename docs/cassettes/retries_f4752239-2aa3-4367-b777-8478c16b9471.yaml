      the summary from the following conversation:\n\n<convo>\nPete: Hey Xu, Laura,
      thanks for hopping on this call. I''ve been itching to talk about this Drake
      and Kendrick situation.\nXu: No problem. As its my job, I''ve got some thoughts
      on this beef.\nLaura: Yeah, I''ve got some insider info so this should be interesting.\nPete:
      Dope. So, when do you think this whole thing started?\nPete: Definitely was
      Kendrick''s ''Control'' verse that kicked it off.\nLaura: Truth, but Drake never
      went after him directly. Just some subtle jabs here and there.\nXu: That''s
      the thing with beefs like this, though. They''ve always been a a thing, pushing
      artists to step up their game.\nPete: For sure, and this beef has got the fans
      taking sides. Some are all about Drake''s mainstream appeal, while others are
      digging Kendrick''s lyrical skills.\nLaura: I mean, Drake knows how to make
      a hit that gets everyone hyped. That''s his thing.\nPete: I hear you, Laura,
      but I gotta give it to Kendrick when it comes to straight-up bars. The man''s
      a beast on the mic.\nXu: It''s wild how this beef is shaping fans.\nPete: do
      you think these beefs can actually be good for hip-hop?\nXu: Hell yeah, Pete.
      When it''s done right, a beef can push the genre forward and make artists level
      up.\nLaura: eh\nPete: So, where do you see this beef going?\nLaura: Honestly,
      I think it''ll stay a hot topic for the fans, but unless someone drops a straight-up
      diss track, it''s not gonna escalate.\nLaura: ehhhhhh not sure\nPete: I feel
      that. I just want both of them to keep dropping heat, beef or no beef.\nXu:
      I''m curious. May influence a lot of people. Make things more competitive. Bring
      on a whole new wave of lyricism.\nPete: Word. Hey, thanks for chopping it up
      with me, Xu and Laura. This was dope.\nXu: Where are you going so fast?\nLaura:
      For real, I had a good time. Nice to get different perspectives on the situation.\n</convo>\n\nRemember

      the summary from the following conversation:\n\n<convo>\nPete: Hey Xu, Laura,
      thanks for hopping on this call. I''ve been itching to talk about this Drake
      and Kendrick situation.\nXu: No problem. As its my job, I''ve got some thoughts
      on this beef.\nLaura: Yeah, I''ve got some insider info so this should be interesting.\nPete:
      Dope. So, when do you think this whole thing started?\nPete: Definitely was
      Kendrick''s ''Control'' verse that kicked it off.\nLaura: Truth, but Drake never
      went after him directly. Just some subtle jabs here and there.\nXu: That''s
      the thing with beefs like this, though. They''ve always been a a thing, pushing
      artists to step up their game.\nPete: For sure, and this beef has got the fans
      taking sides. Some are all about Drake''s mainstream appeal, while others are
      digging Kendrick''s lyrical skills.\nLaura: I mean, Drake knows how to make
      a hit that gets everyone hyped. That''s his thing.\nPete: I hear you, Laura,
      but I gotta give it to Kendrick when it comes to straight-up bars. The man''s
      a beast on the mic.\nXu: It''s wild how this beef is shaping fans.\nPete: do
      you think these beefs can actually be good for hip-hop?\nXu: Hell yeah, Pete.
      When it''s done right, a beef can push the genre forward and make artists level
      up.\nLaura: eh\nPete: So, where do you see this beef going?\nLaura: Honestly,
      I think it''ll stay a hot topic for the fans, but unless someone drops a straight-up
      diss track, it''s not gonna escalate.\nLaura: ehhhhhh not sure\nPete: I feel
      that. I just want both of them to keep dropping heat, beef or no beef.\nXu:
      I''m curious. May influence a lot of people. Make things more competitive. Bring
      on a whole new wave of lyricism.\nPete: Word. Hey, thanks for chopping it up
      with me, Xu and Laura. This was dope.\nXu: Where are you going so fast?\nLaura:
      For real, I had a good time. Nice to get different perspectives on the situation.\n</convo>\n\nRemember
