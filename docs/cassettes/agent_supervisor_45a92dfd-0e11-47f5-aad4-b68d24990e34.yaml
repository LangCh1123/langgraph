      and extreme maximum surface temperatures in August at these sites are 32 and
      38\_\xB0C (90 and 100\_\xB0F), respectively.[22]\\\\nRecent studies suggest
      some populations are declining due to various factors, most notably global warming.[20]
      A 2003 study, published in the Journal of Mammalogy, showed nine of 25 sampled
      populations of American pika had been extirpated in the Great Basin, leading
      biologists to conduct further investigations to determine if the species as
      a whole is vulnerable.[23]\\\\nIn 2010, the US government considered, then decided
      not to add the American pika under the US Endangered Species Act.[24] The original
      scientific name was Lepus (Lagomys) princeps.[18]\\\\nConservation and decline[edit]\\\\nAs
      they live in the high and cooler mountain regions, they are very sensitive to
      high temperatures, and are considered to be one of the best early warning systems
      for detecting global warming in the western United States.[19]\\\\nTemperature
      increases are suspected to be one cause of American pikas moving higher in elevation[20]
      in an attempt to find suitable habitat, as well as cooler temperatures. Distribution
      and habitat[edit]\\\\nThe American pika can be found throughout the mountains
      of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada
      to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
      Nevada, California, and New Mexico.[10] Of the 30 existing species of pika,
      it is one of only two which inhabit North America, along with the collared pika
      (O. collaris). The project concluded in 2016.[26]\\\\nMore recent studies have
      found widespread extirpations and range retractions at lower elevations which
      are typically warmer and drier, patterns that have been further attributed to
      varying aspects of climate change such as warmer summer and winter temperatures
      and changes in precipitation.[27][28][29][30] For example, one study found upslope
      retractions in 44 of 64 watersheds surveyed in the Northern Rockies, with retractions
      averaging 281\_m (922\_ft).[31] Although a pika can meet its water demand from
      the vegetation eaten, it does drink water if it is available in its environment.[14]\\\\nPikas
      have two different ways of foraging; they directly consume food (feeding) or
      they cache food in haypiles to use for a food source in the winter (haying).[11]
      They feed throughout the year while haying is limited to the summer.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\":
      \\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pika\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Pikas do not
      hibernate and remain active throughout the winter by traveling in tunnels under
      rocks and snow and eating dried plants that they have stored.[14] Rock-dwelling
      pikas exhibit two methods of foraging: the first involves direct consumption
      of food, and the second is characterized by the gathering of plants to store
      in a \\\\\\\"haypile\\\\\\\" of cached plants.[15]\\\\nThe impact of human activity
      on the tundra ecosystems where pikas live has been recorded dating back to the
      1970s.[16] Rather than hibernate during winter, pikas forage for grasses and
      other forms of plant matter and stash these findings in protected dens in a
      process called \\\\\\\"haying\\\\\\\".\\\\n Such interactions with humans have
      been linked to pikas having reduced amounts of foraging time, consequentially
      limiting the amount of food they can stockpile for winter months.[18] Pikas
      prefer foraging in temperatures below 25\_\xB0C (77\_\xB0F), so they generally
      spend their time in shaded regions and out of direct sunlight when temperatures
      are high.[18] A link has also been found between temperature increases and lost
      foraging time, where for every increase of 1\_\xB0C (1.8\_\xB0F) to the ambient
      temperature in alpine landscapes home to pikas, those pikas lose 3% of their
      foraging time.[18]\\\\nEurasian pikas commonly live in family groups and share
      duties of gathering food and keeping watch. Pleistocene fossils of the extant
      steppe pika O. pusilla currently native to Asia have been found also in many
      countries of Europe from the United Kingdom to Russia and from Italy to Poland,
      and the Asiatic extant northern pika O. hyperborea in one location in the middle
      Pleistocene United States.[1]\\\\nWhile Ochotona is the only currently living

      I\\\\nCharacteristics of sites in the hydrological Great Basin, western United
      States, used in relevant analyses, 1994\u20132008, as presented by Beever et
      al. (2011:Appendix V), with calculations of range retraction. In this review
      I 1) review the paleontological history of the American pika in North America;
      2) outline why pikas are an exceptional species to study with regard to environmental
      change; 3) summarize relevant information on the status of pikas across the
      species\u2019 range; 4) highlight aspects of the resiliency of pikas living
      in extreme environments; 5) review how relevant traits of pikas may be impacted
      by environmental change; and 6) present the current conservation status of the
      pika. The mechanistic climatic models of Mathewson et al. (2017) correctly predicted
      the prehistoric retrenchment of pikas in the Great Basin, as well as the current
      distribution of pikas, but failed to account for the presence of pikas at Craters
      of the Moon, Lava Beds National Monument, Newberry National Volcanic Monument,
      or along the Columbia River Gorge (and presumably also at Bodie and the Mono
      Craters; collectively \u201Coutlier sites\u201D). Meanwhile, the pattern of
      occupancy in the northern constellation of patches, while variable from year
      to year, was unchanged; in fact, the documented number of pikas in the north
      in our 2009 and 2010 surveys exceeded the number of pikas counted in the north
      in 1972 or 1977 (Smith and Nagy 2015). Characteristics of Pikas in Stressful
      Environments\\\\nOur understanding of the current distribution and local abundance
      of American pika populations is contingent on a thorough understanding of the
      natural history of the species, notably missing from most of the contemporary
      work on pikas involving regional surveys.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9475130/\\\",
      \\\"content\\\": \\\"Our observations in 2021 of pikas on the Noonday Mine,
      coupled with those of pika occupancy on the Red Cloud Mine and the Booker Consolidated
      shaft (Klingler,\_2017; Nichols et al.,\_2016), indicate that following nearly
      a decade of extirpated status, there have been multiple re\u2010colonization
      episodes from the northern constellation to the southern constellation.\\\\n2.2.
      Nichols et al.\_(2016, p. 167\u2013168) mention seeing a pika in 2015 at an
      undisclosed site 1.2\_km from \u201Cthe nearest occupied patch\u201D \u2013
      most likely the Red Cloud Mine, 400\u2009m from the Noonday Mine (thus, the
      contention earlier in Nichols et al.,\_2016 that the southern constellation
      was extirpated at that time was incorrect). Although we know of only one other
      occupied site at the south end of the Craters, the potential exists for other
      active pika sites near NMCR that could have been the source for the re\u2010colonization

      analyses, 1994\u20132008, as presented by Beever et al. (2011:Appendix V), with
      calculations of range retraction. In this review I 1) review the paleontological
      history of the American pika in North America; 2) outline why pikas are an exceptional
      species to study with regard to environmental change; 3) summarize relevant
      information on the status of pikas across the species\u2019 range; 4) highlight
      aspects of the resiliency of pikas living in extreme environments; 5) review
      how relevant traits of pikas may be impacted by environmental change; and 6)
      present the current conservation status of the pika. The mechanistic climatic
      models of Mathewson et al. (2017) correctly predicted the prehistoric retrenchment
      of pikas in the Great Basin, as well as the current distribution of pikas, but
      failed to account for the presence of pikas at Craters of the Moon, Lava Beds
      National Monument, Newberry National Volcanic Monument, or along the Columbia
      River Gorge (and presumably also at Bodie and the Mono Craters; collectively
      \u201Coutlier sites\u201D). Meanwhile, the pattern of occupancy in the northern
      constellation of patches, while variable from year to year, was unchanged; in
      fact, the documented number of pikas in the north in our 2009 and 2010 surveys
      exceeded the number of pikas counted in the north in 1972 or 1977 (Smith and
      Nagy 2015). Characteristics of Pikas in Stressful Environments\\nOur understanding
      of the current distribution and local abundance of American pika populations
      is contingent on a thorough understanding of the natural history of the species,
      notably missing from most of the contemporary work on pikas involving regional
      surveys.\",\"score\":0.9558167,\"raw_content\":null},{\"title\":\"Return of

      and extreme maximum surface temperatures in August at these sites are 32 and
      38\_\xB0C (90 and 100\_\xB0F), respectively.[22]\\\\nRecent studies suggest
      some populations are declining due to various factors, most notably global warming.[20]
      A 2003 study, published in the Journal of Mammalogy, showed nine of 25 sampled
      populations of American pika had been extirpated in the Great Basin, leading
      biologists to conduct further investigations to determine if the species as
      a whole is vulnerable.[23]\\\\nIn 2010, the US government considered, then decided
      not to add the American pika under the US Endangered Species Act.[24] The original
      scientific name was Lepus (Lagomys) princeps.[18]\\\\nConservation and decline[edit]\\\\nAs
      they live in the high and cooler mountain regions, they are very sensitive to
      high temperatures, and are considered to be one of the best early warning systems
      for detecting global warming in the western United States.[19]\\\\nTemperature
      increases are suspected to be one cause of American pikas moving higher in elevation[20]
      in an attempt to find suitable habitat, as well as cooler temperatures. Distribution
      and habitat[edit]\\\\nThe American pika can be found throughout the mountains
      of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada
      to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
      Nevada, California, and New Mexico.[10] Of the 30 existing species of pika,
      it is one of only two which inhabit North America, along with the collared pika
      (O. collaris). The project concluded in 2016.[26]\\\\nMore recent studies have
      found widespread extirpations and range retractions at lower elevations which
      are typically warmer and drier, patterns that have been further attributed to
      varying aspects of climate change such as warmer summer and winter temperatures
      and changes in precipitation.[27][28][29][30] For example, one study found upslope
      retractions in 44 of 64 watersheds surveyed in the Northern Rockies, with retractions
      averaging 281\_m (922\_ft).[31] Although a pika can meet its water demand from
      the vegetation eaten, it does drink water if it is available in its environment.[14]\\\\nPikas
      have two different ways of foraging; they directly consume food (feeding) or
      they cache food in haypiles to use for a food source in the winter (haying).[11]
      They feed throughout the year while haying is limited to the summer.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\":
      \\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pika\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Pikas do not
      hibernate and remain active throughout the winter by traveling in tunnels under
      rocks and snow and eating dried plants that they have stored.[14] Rock-dwelling
      pikas exhibit two methods of foraging: the first involves direct consumption
      of food, and the second is characterized by the gathering of plants to store
      in a \\\\\\\"haypile\\\\\\\" of cached plants.[15]\\\\nThe impact of human activity
      on the tundra ecosystems where pikas live has been recorded dating back to the
      1970s.[16] Rather than hibernate during winter, pikas forage for grasses and
      other forms of plant matter and stash these findings in protected dens in a
      process called \\\\\\\"haying\\\\\\\".\\\\n Such interactions with humans have
      been linked to pikas having reduced amounts of foraging time, consequentially
      limiting the amount of food they can stockpile for winter months.[18] Pikas
      prefer foraging in temperatures below 25\_\xB0C (77\_\xB0F), so they generally
      spend their time in shaded regions and out of direct sunlight when temperatures
      are high.[18] A link has also been found between temperature increases and lost
      foraging time, where for every increase of 1\_\xB0C (1.8\_\xB0F) to the ambient
      temperature in alpine landscapes home to pikas, those pikas lose 3% of their
      foraging time.[18]\\\\nEurasian pikas commonly live in family groups and share
      duties of gathering food and keeping watch. Pleistocene fossils of the extant
      steppe pika O. pusilla currently native to Asia have been found also in many
      countries of Europe from the United Kingdom to Russia and from Italy to Poland,
      and the Asiatic extant northern pika O. hyperborea in one location in the middle
      Pleistocene United States.[1]\\\\nWhile Ochotona is the only currently living
      genus of Ochotonidae, extinct genera of ochotonids include\\\\n\u2020Albertona,

      is Desmatolagus (middle Eocene to Miocene, 42.5\u201314.8 Ma[1]), usually included
      in the Ochotonidae, sometimes in Leporidae or in neither ochotonid nor leporid
      stem-lagomorphs.[36]\\\\nOchotonids appeared in Asia between the late Eocene
      and the early Oligocene, and continued to develop along with increased distribution
      of C3 grasses in previously forest dominated areas under the \\\\\\\"climatic
      optimum\\\\\\\" from the late Oligocene to middle Miocene. The North American
      collared pika (O. collaris) and American pika (O. princeps) have been suggested
      to have descended from the same ancestor as the steppe pika (O. pusilla).[25]\\\\nThe
      range of Ochotona was larger in the past, with both extinct and extant species
      inhabiting Western Europe and Eastern North America, areas that are currently

      A 2003 study, published in the Journal of Mammalogy, showed nine of 25 sampled
      populations of American pika had been extirpated in the Great Basin, leading
      biologists to conduct further investigations to determine if the species as

      not to add the American pika under the US Endangered Species Act.[24] The original
      scientific name was Lepus (Lagomys) princeps.[18]\\nConservation and decline[edit]\\nAs
      they live in the high and cooler mountain regions, they are very sensitive to
      high temperatures, and are considered to be one of the best early warning systems
      for detecting global warming in the western United States.[19]\\nTemperature
      increases are suspected to be one cause of American pikas moving higher in elevation[20]
      in an attempt to find suitable habitat, as well as cooler temperatures. Distribution
      and habitat[edit]\\nThe American pika can be found throughout the mountains
      of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada
      to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
      Nevada, California, and New Mexico.[10] Of the 30 existing species of pika,
      it is one of only two which inhabit North America, along with the collared pika
      (O. collaris). The project concluded in 2016.[26]\\nMore recent studies have
      found widespread extirpations and range retractions at lower elevations which
      are typically warmer and drier, patterns that have been further attributed to
      varying aspects of climate change such as warmer summer and winter temperatures
      and changes in precipitation.[27][28][29][30] For example, one study found upslope
      retractions in 44 of 64 watersheds surveyed in the Northern Rockies, with retractions
      averaging 281\_m (922\_ft).[31] Although a pika can meet its water demand from
      the vegetation eaten, it does drink water if it is available in its environment.[14]\\nPikas
      have two different ways of foraging; they directly consume food (feeding) or
      they cache food in haypiles to use for a food source in the winter (haying).[11]
      They feed throughout the year while haying is limited to the summer.\",\"score\":0.9972316,\"raw_content\":null},{\"title\":\"Pika
      - Wikipedia\",\"url\":\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pika\",\"content\":\"Pikas
      do not hibernate and remain active throughout the winter by traveling in tunnels
      under rocks and snow and eating dried plants that they have stored.[14] Rock-dwelling
      pikas exhibit two methods of foraging: the first involves direct consumption
      of food, and the second is characterized by the gathering of plants to store
      in a \\\"haypile\\\" of cached plants.[15]\\nThe impact of human activity on
      the tundra ecosystems where pikas live has been recorded dating back to the
      1970s.[16] Rather than hibernate during winter, pikas forage for grasses and
      other forms of plant matter and stash these findings in protected dens in a
      process called \\\"haying\\\".\\n Such interactions with humans have been linked
      to pikas having reduced amounts of foraging time, consequentially limiting the
      amount of food they can stockpile for winter months.[18] Pikas prefer foraging
      in temperatures below 25\_\xB0C (77\_\xB0F), so they generally spend their time
      in shaded regions and out of direct sunlight when temperatures are high.[18]
      A link has also been found between temperature increases and lost foraging time,
      where for every increase of 1\_\xB0C (1.8\_\xB0F) to the ambient temperature
      in alpine landscapes home to pikas, those pikas lose 3% of their foraging time.[18]\\nEurasian
      pikas commonly live in family groups and share duties of gathering food and
      keeping watch. Pleistocene fossils of the extant steppe pika O. pusilla currently
      native to Asia have been found also in many countries of Europe from the United
      Kingdom to Russia and from Italy to Poland, and the Asiatic extant northern
      pika O. hyperborea in one location in the middle Pleistocene United States.[1]\\nWhile
      Ochotona is the only currently living genus of Ochotonidae, extinct genera of
      ochotonids include\\n\u2020Albertona, \u2020Alloptox, \u2020Amphilagus, \u2020Australagomys,

      is Desmatolagus (middle Eocene to Miocene, 42.5\u201314.8 Ma[1]), usually included
      in the Ochotonidae, sometimes in Leporidae or in neither ochotonid nor leporid
      stem-lagomorphs.[36]\\nOchotonids appeared in Asia between the late Eocene and
      the early Oligocene, and continued to develop along with increased distribution
      of C3 grasses in previously forest dominated areas under the \\\"climatic optimum\\\"
      from the late Oligocene to middle Miocene. The North American collared pika
      (O. collaris) and American pika (O. princeps) have been suggested to have descended
      from the same ancestor as the steppe pika (O. pusilla).[25]\\nThe range of Ochotona

      States, used in relevant analyses, 1994\u20132008, as presented by Beever et
      al. (2011:Appendix V), with calculations of range retraction. In this review
      I 1) review the paleontological history of the American pika in North America;
      2) outline why pikas are an exceptional species to study with regard to environmental
      change; 3) summarize relevant information on the status of pikas across the
      species\u2019 range; 4) highlight aspects of the resiliency of pikas living
      in extreme environments; 5) review how relevant traits of pikas may be impacted
      by environmental change; and 6) present the current conservation status of the
      pika. The mechanistic climatic models of Mathewson et al. (2017) correctly predicted
      the prehistoric retrenchment of pikas in the Great Basin, as well as the current
      distribution of pikas, but failed to account for the presence of pikas at Craters
      of the Moon, Lava Beds National Monument, Newberry National Volcanic Monument,
      or along the Columbia River Gorge (and presumably also at Bodie and the Mono
      Craters; collectively \u201Coutlier sites\u201D). Meanwhile, the pattern of
      occupancy in the northern constellation of patches, while variable from year
      to year, was unchanged; in fact, the documented number of pikas in the north
      in our 2009 and 2010 surveys exceeded the number of pikas counted in the north
      in 1972 or 1977 (Smith and Nagy 2015). Characteristics of Pikas in Stressful
      Environments\\\\nOur understanding of the current distribution and local abundance
      of American pika populations is contingent on a thorough understanding of the
      natural history of the species, notably missing from most of the contemporary

      and extreme maximum surface temperatures in August at these sites are 32 and
      38\_\xB0C (90 and 100\_\xB0F), respectively.[22]\\\\nRecent studies suggest
      some populations are declining due to various factors, most notably global warming.[20]
      A 2003 study, published in the Journal of Mammalogy, showed nine of 25 sampled
      populations of American pika had been extirpated in the Great Basin, leading
      biologists to conduct further investigations to determine if the species as
      a whole is vulnerable.[23]\\\\nIn 2010, the US government considered, then decided
      not to add the American pika under the US Endangered Species Act.[24] The original
      scientific name was Lepus (Lagomys) princeps.[18]\\\\nConservation and decline[edit]\\\\nAs
      they live in the high and cooler mountain regions, they are very sensitive to
      high temperatures, and are considered to be one of the best early warning systems
      for detecting global warming in the western United States.[19]\\\\nTemperature
      increases are suspected to be one cause of American pikas moving higher in elevation[20]
      in an attempt to find suitable habitat, as well as cooler temperatures. Distribution
      and habitat[edit]\\\\nThe American pika can be found throughout the mountains
      of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada
      to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
      Nevada, California, and New Mexico.[10] Of the 30 existing species of pika,
      it is one of only two which inhabit North America, along with the collared pika
      (O. collaris). The project concluded in 2016.[26]\\\\nMore recent studies have
      found widespread extirpations and range retractions at lower elevations which
      are typically warmer and drier, patterns that have been further attributed to
      varying aspects of climate change such as warmer summer and winter temperatures
      and changes in precipitation.[27][28][29][30] For example, one study found upslope
      retractions in 44 of 64 watersheds surveyed in the Northern Rockies, with retractions
      averaging 281\_m (922\_ft).[31] Although a pika can meet its water demand from
      the vegetation eaten, it does drink water if it is available in its environment.[14]\\\\nPikas
      have two different ways of foraging; they directly consume food (feeding) or
      they cache food in haypiles to use for a food source in the winter (haying).[11]
      They feed throughout the year while haying is limited to the summer.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\":
      \\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pika\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Pikas do not
      hibernate and remain active throughout the winter by traveling in tunnels under
      rocks and snow and eating dried plants that they have stored.[14] Rock-dwelling
      pikas exhibit two methods of foraging: the first involves direct consumption
      of food, and the second is characterized by the gathering of plants to store
      in a \\\\\\\"haypile\\\\\\\" of cached plants.[15]\\\\nThe impact of human activity
      on the tundra ecosystems where pikas live has been recorded dating back to the
      1970s.[16] Rather than hibernate during winter, pikas forage for grasses and
      other forms of plant matter and stash these findings in protected dens in a
      process called \\\\\\\"haying\\\\\\\".\\\\n Such interactions with humans have
      been linked to pikas having reduced amounts of foraging time, consequentially
      limiting the amount of food they can stockpile for winter months.[18] Pikas
      prefer foraging in temperatures below 25\_\xB0C (77\_\xB0F), so they generally
      spend their time in shaded regions and out of direct sunlight when temperatures
      are high.[18] A link has also been found between temperature increases and lost
      foraging time, where for every increase of 1\_\xB0C (1.8\_\xB0F) to the ambient
      temperature in alpine landscapes home to pikas, those pikas lose 3% of their
      foraging time.[18]\\\\nEurasian pikas commonly live in family groups and share
      duties of gathering food and keeping watch. Pleistocene fossils of the extant
      steppe pika O. pusilla currently native to Asia have been found also in many
      countries of Europe from the United Kingdom to Russia and from Italy to Poland,
      and the Asiatic extant northern pika O. hyperborea in one location in the middle
      Pleistocene United States.[1]\\\\nWhile Ochotona is the only currently living

      I\\\\nCharacteristics of sites in the hydrological Great Basin, western United
      States, used in relevant analyses, 1994\u20132008, as presented by Beever et
      al. (2011:Appendix V), with calculations of range retraction. In this review
      I 1) review the paleontological history of the American pika in North America;
      2) outline why pikas are an exceptional species to study with regard to environmental
      change; 3) summarize relevant information on the status of pikas across the
      species\u2019 range; 4) highlight aspects of the resiliency of pikas living
      in extreme environments; 5) review how relevant traits of pikas may be impacted
      by environmental change; and 6) present the current conservation status of the
      pika. The mechanistic climatic models of Mathewson et al. (2017) correctly predicted
      the prehistoric retrenchment of pikas in the Great Basin, as well as the current
      distribution of pikas, but failed to account for the presence of pikas at Craters
      of the Moon, Lava Beds National Monument, Newberry National Volcanic Monument,
      or along the Columbia River Gorge (and presumably also at Bodie and the Mono
      Craters; collectively \u201Coutlier sites\u201D). Meanwhile, the pattern of
      occupancy in the northern constellation of patches, while variable from year
      to year, was unchanged; in fact, the documented number of pikas in the north
      in our 2009 and 2010 surveys exceeded the number of pikas counted in the north
      in 1972 or 1977 (Smith and Nagy 2015). Characteristics of Pikas in Stressful
      Environments\\\\nOur understanding of the current distribution and local abundance
      of American pika populations is contingent on a thorough understanding of the
      natural history of the species, notably missing from most of the contemporary
      work on pikas involving regional surveys.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9475130/\\\",
      \\\"content\\\": \\\"Our observations in 2021 of pikas on the Noonday Mine,
      coupled with those of pika occupancy on the Red Cloud Mine and the Booker Consolidated
      shaft (Klingler,\_2017; Nichols et al.,\_2016), indicate that following nearly
      a decade of extirpated status, there have been multiple re\u2010colonization
      episodes from the northern constellation to the southern constellation.\\\\n2.2.
      Nichols et al.\_(2016, p. 167\u2013168) mention seeing a pika in 2015 at an
      undisclosed site 1.2\_km from \u201Cthe nearest occupied patch\u201D \u2013
      most likely the Red Cloud Mine, 400\u2009m from the Noonday Mine (thus, the
      contention earlier in Nichols et al.,\_2016 that the southern constellation
      was extirpated at that time was incorrect). Although we know of only one other
      occupied site at the south end of the Craters, the potential exists for other
      active pika sites near NMCR that could have been the source for the re\u2010colonization
      observed in 2021 \u2013 such as the apparently transient individual observed
      via our camera trap in 2018 (Millar & Hickman,\_2021). At the far north end
      of the Mono Craters, 7\_km from the Pumice Mine site, Millar (Millar & Hickman,\_2021;
      Millar et al.,\_2013; C. I. Millar, unpublished observations) has been monitoring
      the presence of pika sites since 2011 (North Mono Craters, NMCR; 2092\u20132260\u2009m;
      Figures\_1c and \u200Band2c).2c). C. I. Millar (unpublished surveys) has extensively
      explored talus habitat throughout the Mono Craters since 2009 using widely accepted
      methods for evaluating occupancy as follows: current occupancy of a talus (pika
      seen or heard and/or presence of current\u2010year haypile vegetation), former
      occupancy (only old haypile vegetation or dried, decomposing fecal pellets),

      analyses, 1994\u20132008, as presented by Beever et al. (2011:Appendix V), with
      calculations of range retraction. In this review I 1) review the paleontological
      history of the American pika in North America; 2) outline why pikas are an exceptional
      species to study with regard to environmental change; 3) summarize relevant
      information on the status of pikas across the species\u2019 range; 4) highlight
      aspects of the resiliency of pikas living in extreme environments; 5) review
      how relevant traits of pikas may be impacted by environmental change; and 6)
      present the current conservation status of the pika. The mechanistic climatic
      models of Mathewson et al. (2017) correctly predicted the prehistoric retrenchment
      of pikas in the Great Basin, as well as the current distribution of pikas, but
      failed to account for the presence of pikas at Craters of the Moon, Lava Beds
      National Monument, Newberry National Volcanic Monument, or along the Columbia
      River Gorge (and presumably also at Bodie and the Mono Craters; collectively
      \u201Coutlier sites\u201D). Meanwhile, the pattern of occupancy in the northern
      constellation of patches, while variable from year to year, was unchanged; in
      fact, the documented number of pikas in the north in our 2009 and 2010 surveys
      exceeded the number of pikas counted in the north in 1972 or 1977 (Smith and
      Nagy 2015). Characteristics of Pikas in Stressful Environments\\nOur understanding
      of the current distribution and local abundance of American pika populations
      is contingent on a thorough understanding of the natural history of the species,
      notably missing from most of the contemporary work on pikas involving regional
      surveys.\",\"score\":0.9558167,\"raw_content\":null},{\"title\":\"Return of

      Although we know of only one other occupied site at the south end of the Craters,

      and extreme maximum surface temperatures in August at these sites are 32 and
      38\_\xB0C (90 and 100\_\xB0F), respectively.[22]\\\\nRecent studies suggest
      some populations are declining due to various factors, most notably global warming.[20]
      A 2003 study, published in the Journal of Mammalogy, showed nine of 25 sampled
      populations of American pika had been extirpated in the Great Basin, leading
      biologists to conduct further investigations to determine if the species as
      a whole is vulnerable.[23]\\\\nIn 2010, the US government considered, then decided
      not to add the American pika under the US Endangered Species Act.[24] The original
      scientific name was Lepus (Lagomys) princeps.[18]\\\\nConservation and decline[edit]\\\\nAs
      they live in the high and cooler mountain regions, they are very sensitive to
      high temperatures, and are considered to be one of the best early warning systems
      for detecting global warming in the western United States.[19]\\\\nTemperature
      increases are suspected to be one cause of American pikas moving higher in elevation[20]
      in an attempt to find suitable habitat, as well as cooler temperatures. Distribution
      and habitat[edit]\\\\nThe American pika can be found throughout the mountains
      of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada
      to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
      Nevada, California, and New Mexico.[10] Of the 30 existing species of pika,
      it is one of only two which inhabit North America, along with the collared pika
      (O. collaris). The project concluded in 2016.[26]\\\\nMore recent studies have
      found widespread extirpations and range retractions at lower elevations which
      are typically warmer and drier, patterns that have been further attributed to
      varying aspects of climate change such as warmer summer and winter temperatures
      and changes in precipitation.[27][28][29][30] For example, one study found upslope
      retractions in 44 of 64 watersheds surveyed in the Northern Rockies, with retractions
      averaging 281\_m (922\_ft).[31] Although a pika can meet its water demand from
      the vegetation eaten, it does drink water if it is available in its environment.[14]\\\\nPikas
      have two different ways of foraging; they directly consume food (feeding) or
      they cache food in haypiles to use for a food source in the winter (haying).[11]
      They feed throughout the year while haying is limited to the summer.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\":
      \\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pika\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Pikas do not
      hibernate and remain active throughout the winter by traveling in tunnels under
      rocks and snow and eating dried plants that they have stored.[14] Rock-dwelling
      pikas exhibit two methods of foraging: the first involves direct consumption
      of food, and the second is characterized by the gathering of plants to store
      in a \\\\\\\"haypile\\\\\\\" of cached plants.[15]\\\\nThe impact of human activity
      on the tundra ecosystems where pikas live has been recorded dating back to the
      1970s.[16] Rather than hibernate during winter, pikas forage for grasses and
      other forms of plant matter and stash these findings in protected dens in a
      process called \\\\\\\"haying\\\\\\\".\\\\n Such interactions with humans have
      been linked to pikas having reduced amounts of foraging time, consequentially
      limiting the amount of food they can stockpile for winter months.[18] Pikas
      prefer foraging in temperatures below 25\_\xB0C (77\_\xB0F), so they generally
      spend their time in shaded regions and out of direct sunlight when temperatures
      are high.[18] A link has also been found between temperature increases and lost
      foraging time, where for every increase of 1\_\xB0C (1.8\_\xB0F) to the ambient
      temperature in alpine landscapes home to pikas, those pikas lose 3% of their
      foraging time.[18]\\\\nEurasian pikas commonly live in family groups and share
      duties of gathering food and keeping watch. Pleistocene fossils of the extant
      steppe pika O. pusilla currently native to Asia have been found also in many
      countries of Europe from the United Kingdom to Russia and from Italy to Poland,
      and the Asiatic extant northern pika O. hyperborea in one location in the middle
      Pleistocene United States.[1]\\\\nWhile Ochotona is the only currently living

      populations are declining due to various factors, most notably global warming.[20]
      A 2003 study, published in the Journal of Mammalogy, showed nine of 25 sampled
      populations of American pika had been extirpated in the Great Basin, leading
      biologists to conduct further investigations to determine if the species as
      a whole is vulnerable.[23]\\nIn 2010, the US government considered, then decided
      not to add the American pika under the US Endangered Species Act.[24] The original
      scientific name was Lepus (Lagomys) princeps.[18]\\nConservation and decline[edit]\\nAs
      they live in the high and cooler mountain regions, they are very sensitive to
      high temperatures, and are considered to be one of the best early warning systems
      for detecting global warming in the western United States.[19]\\nTemperature
      increases are suspected to be one cause of American pikas moving higher in elevation[20]
      in an attempt to find suitable habitat, as well as cooler temperatures. Distribution
      and habitat[edit]\\nThe American pika can be found throughout the mountains
      of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada
      to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
      Nevada, California, and New Mexico.[10] Of the 30 existing species of pika,
      it is one of only two which inhabit North America, along with the collared pika
      (O. collaris). The project concluded in 2016.[26]\\nMore recent studies have
      found widespread extirpations and range retractions at lower elevations which
      are typically warmer and drier, patterns that have been further attributed to
      varying aspects of climate change such as warmer summer and winter temperatures
      and changes in precipitation.[27][28][29][30] For example, one study found upslope
      retractions in 44 of 64 watersheds surveyed in the Northern Rockies, with retractions
      averaging 281\_m (922\_ft).[31] Although a pika can meet its water demand from
      the vegetation eaten, it does drink water if it is available in its environment.[14]\\nPikas
      have two different ways of foraging; they directly consume food (feeding) or
      they cache food in haypiles to use for a food source in the winter (haying).[11]
      They feed throughout the year while haying is limited to the summer.\",\"score\":0.9972316,\"raw_content\":null},{\"title\":\"Pika
      - Wikipedia\",\"url\":\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pika\",\"content\":\"Pikas
      do not hibernate and remain active throughout the winter by traveling in tunnels
      under rocks and snow and eating dried plants that they have stored.[14] Rock-dwelling
      pikas exhibit two methods of foraging: the first involves direct consumption
      of food, and the second is characterized by the gathering of plants to store
      in a \\\"haypile\\\" of cached plants.[15]\\nThe impact of human activity on
      the tundra ecosystems where pikas live has been recorded dating back to the
      1970s.[16] Rather than hibernate during winter, pikas forage for grasses and
      other forms of plant matter and stash these findings in protected dens in a
      process called \\\"haying\\\".\\n Such interactions with humans have been linked
      to pikas having reduced amounts of foraging time, consequentially limiting the
      amount of food they can stockpile for winter months.[18] Pikas prefer foraging
      in temperatures below 25\_\xB0C (77\_\xB0F), so they generally spend their time
      in shaded regions and out of direct sunlight when temperatures are high.[18]
      A link has also been found between temperature increases and lost foraging time,
      where for every increase of 1\_\xB0C (1.8\_\xB0F) to the ambient temperature
      in alpine landscapes home to pikas, those pikas lose 3% of their foraging time.[18]\\nEurasian
      pikas commonly live in family groups and share duties of gathering food and
      keeping watch. Pleistocene fossils of the extant steppe pika O. pusilla currently
      native to Asia have been found also in many countries of Europe from the United
      Kingdom to Russia and from Italy to Poland, and the Asiatic extant northern
      pika O. hyperborea in one location in the middle Pleistocene United States.[1]\\nWhile

      I\\\\nCharacteristics of sites in the hydrological Great Basin, western United
      States, used in relevant analyses, 1994\u20132008, as presented by Beever et
      al. (2011:Appendix V), with calculations of range retraction. In this review
      I 1) review the paleontological history of the American pika in North America;
      2) outline why pikas are an exceptional species to study with regard to environmental
      change; 3) summarize relevant information on the status of pikas across the
      species\u2019 range; 4) highlight aspects of the resiliency of pikas living
      in extreme environments; 5) review how relevant traits of pikas may be impacted
      by environmental change; and 6) present the current conservation status of the
      pika. The mechanistic climatic models of Mathewson et al. (2017) correctly predicted
      the prehistoric retrenchment of pikas in the Great Basin, as well as the current
      distribution of pikas, but failed to account for the presence of pikas at Craters
      of the Moon, Lava Beds National Monument, Newberry National Volcanic Monument,
      or along the Columbia River Gorge (and presumably also at Bodie and the Mono
      Craters; collectively \u201Coutlier sites\u201D). Meanwhile, the pattern of
      occupancy in the northern constellation of patches, while variable from year
      to year, was unchanged; in fact, the documented number of pikas in the north
      in our 2009 and 2010 surveys exceeded the number of pikas counted in the north
      in 1972 or 1977 (Smith and Nagy 2015). Characteristics of Pikas in Stressful
      Environments\\\\nOur understanding of the current distribution and local abundance
      of American pika populations is contingent on a thorough understanding of the
      natural history of the species, notably missing from most of the contemporary
      work on pikas involving regional surveys.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9475130/\\\",

      occupied site at the south end of the Craters, the potential exists for other
      active pika sites near NMCR that could have been the source for the re\u2010colonization
      observed in 2021 \u2013 such as the apparently transient individual observed
      via our camera trap in 2018 (Millar & Hickman,\_2021). At the far north end

      explored talus habitat throughout the Mono Craters since 2009 using widely accepted
      methods for evaluating occupancy as follows: current occupancy of a talus (pika
      seen or heard and/or presence of current\u2010year haypile vegetation), former
      occupancy (only old haypile vegetation or dried, decomposing fecal pellets),
      or no indication of occupancy (none of these signs; Beever et al.,\_2003; Jeffress

      and extreme maximum surface temperatures in August at these sites are 32 and
      38\_\xB0C (90 and 100\_\xB0F), respectively.[22]\\\\nRecent studies suggest
      some populations are declining due to various factors, most notably global warming.[20]
      A 2003 study, published in the Journal of Mammalogy, showed nine of 25 sampled
      populations of American pika had been extirpated in the Great Basin, leading
      biologists to conduct further investigations to determine if the species as
      a whole is vulnerable.[23]\\\\nIn 2010, the US government considered, then decided
      not to add the American pika under the US Endangered Species Act.[24] The original
      scientific name was Lepus (Lagomys) princeps.[18]\\\\nConservation and decline[edit]\\\\nAs
      they live in the high and cooler mountain regions, they are very sensitive to
      high temperatures, and are considered to be one of the best early warning systems
      for detecting global warming in the western United States.[19]\\\\nTemperature
      increases are suspected to be one cause of American pikas moving higher in elevation[20]
      in an attempt to find suitable habitat, as well as cooler temperatures. Distribution
      and habitat[edit]\\\\nThe American pika can be found throughout the mountains
      of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada
      to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
      Nevada, California, and New Mexico.[10] Of the 30 existing species of pika,
      it is one of only two which inhabit North America, along with the collared pika
      (O. collaris). The project concluded in 2016.[26]\\\\nMore recent studies have
      found widespread extirpations and range retractions at lower elevations which
      are typically warmer and drier, patterns that have been further attributed to
      varying aspects of climate change such as warmer summer and winter temperatures
      and changes in precipitation.[27][28][29][30] For example, one study found upslope
      retractions in 44 of 64 watersheds surveyed in the Northern Rockies, with retractions
      averaging 281\_m (922\_ft).[31] Although a pika can meet its water demand from
      the vegetation eaten, it does drink water if it is available in its environment.[14]\\\\nPikas
      have two different ways of foraging; they directly consume food (feeding) or
      they cache food in haypiles to use for a food source in the winter (haying).[11]
      They feed throughout the year while haying is limited to the summer.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\":
      \\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pika\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Pikas do not
      hibernate and remain active throughout the winter by traveling in tunnels under
      rocks and snow and eating dried plants that they have stored.[14] Rock-dwelling
      pikas exhibit two methods of foraging: the first involves direct consumption
      of food, and the second is characterized by the gathering of plants to store
      in a \\\\\\\"haypile\\\\\\\" of cached plants.[15]\\\\nThe impact of human activity
      on the tundra ecosystems where pikas live has been recorded dating back to the
      1970s.[16] Rather than hibernate during winter, pikas forage for grasses and
      other forms of plant matter and stash these findings in protected dens in a
      process called \\\\\\\"haying\\\\\\\".\\\\n Such interactions with humans have
      been linked to pikas having reduced amounts of foraging time, consequentially
      limiting the amount of food they can stockpile for winter months.[18] Pikas
      prefer foraging in temperatures below 25\_\xB0C (77\_\xB0F), so they generally
      spend their time in shaded regions and out of direct sunlight when temperatures
      are high.[18] A link has also been found between temperature increases and lost
      foraging time, where for every increase of 1\_\xB0C (1.8\_\xB0F) to the ambient
      temperature in alpine landscapes home to pikas, those pikas lose 3% of their
      foraging time.[18]\\\\nEurasian pikas commonly live in family groups and share
      duties of gathering food and keeping watch. Pleistocene fossils of the extant
      steppe pika O. pusilla currently native to Asia have been found also in many
      countries of Europe from the United Kingdom to Russia and from Italy to Poland,
      and the Asiatic extant northern pika O. hyperborea in one location in the middle
      Pleistocene United States.[1]\\\\nWhile Ochotona is the only currently living

      in the Ochotonidae, sometimes in Leporidae or in neither ochotonid nor leporid
      stem-lagomorphs.[36]\\\\nOchotonids appeared in Asia between the late Eocene
      and the early Oligocene, and continued to develop along with increased distribution

      A 2003 study, published in the Journal of Mammalogy, showed nine of 25 sampled

      of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada
      to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
      Nevada, California, and New Mexico.[10] Of the 30 existing species of pika,

      I\\\\nCharacteristics of sites in the hydrological Great Basin, western United
      States, used in relevant analyses, 1994\u20132008, as presented by Beever et
      al. (2011:Appendix V), with calculations of range retraction. In this review
      I 1) review the paleontological history of the American pika in North America;
      2) outline why pikas are an exceptional species to study with regard to environmental
      change; 3) summarize relevant information on the status of pikas across the
      species\u2019 range; 4) highlight aspects of the resiliency of pikas living
      in extreme environments; 5) review how relevant traits of pikas may be impacted
      by environmental change; and 6) present the current conservation status of the
      pika. The mechanistic climatic models of Mathewson et al. (2017) correctly predicted
      the prehistoric retrenchment of pikas in the Great Basin, as well as the current
      distribution of pikas, but failed to account for the presence of pikas at Craters
      of the Moon, Lava Beds National Monument, Newberry National Volcanic Monument,
      or along the Columbia River Gorge (and presumably also at Bodie and the Mono
      Craters; collectively \u201Coutlier sites\u201D). Meanwhile, the pattern of
      occupancy in the northern constellation of patches, while variable from year
      to year, was unchanged; in fact, the documented number of pikas in the north
      in our 2009 and 2010 surveys exceeded the number of pikas counted in the north
      in 1972 or 1977 (Smith and Nagy 2015). Characteristics of Pikas in Stressful
      Environments\\\\nOur understanding of the current distribution and local abundance
      of American pika populations is contingent on a thorough understanding of the
      natural history of the species, notably missing from most of the contemporary
      work on pikas involving regional surveys.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9475130/\\\",
      \\\"content\\\": \\\"Our observations in 2021 of pikas on the Noonday Mine,
      coupled with those of pika occupancy on the Red Cloud Mine and the Booker Consolidated
      shaft (Klingler,\_2017; Nichols et al.,\_2016), indicate that following nearly
      a decade of extirpated status, there have been multiple re\u2010colonization
      episodes from the northern constellation to the southern constellation.\\\\n2.2.
      Nichols et al.\_(2016, p. 167\u2013168) mention seeing a pika in 2015 at an
      undisclosed site 1.2\_km from \u201Cthe nearest occupied patch\u201D \u2013
      most likely the Red Cloud Mine, 400\u2009m from the Noonday Mine (thus, the
      contention earlier in Nichols et al.,\_2016 that the southern constellation
      was extirpated at that time was incorrect). Although we know of only one other
      occupied site at the south end of the Craters, the potential exists for other
      active pika sites near NMCR that could have been the source for the re\u2010colonization
      observed in 2021 \u2013 such as the apparently transient individual observed
      via our camera trap in 2018 (Millar & Hickman,\_2021). At the far north end
      of the Mono Craters, 7\_km from the Pumice Mine site, Millar (Millar & Hickman,\_2021;
      Millar et al.,\_2013; C. I. Millar, unpublished observations) has been monitoring
      the presence of pika sites since 2011 (North Mono Craters, NMCR; 2092\u20132260\u2009m;
      Figures\_1c and \u200Band2c).2c). C. I. Millar (unpublished surveys) has extensively
      explored talus habitat throughout the Mono Craters since 2009 using widely accepted
      methods for evaluating occupancy as follows: current occupancy of a talus (pika
      seen or heard and/or presence of current\u2010year haypile vegetation), former
      occupancy (only old haypile vegetation or dried, decomposing fecal pellets),
      or no indication of occupancy (none of these signs; Beever et al.,\_2003; Jeffress

      A 2003 study, published in the Journal of Mammalogy, showed nine of 25 sampled
      populations of American pika had been extirpated in the Great Basin, leading
      biologists to conduct further investigations to determine if the species as
      a whole is vulnerable.[23]\\\\nIn 2010, the US government considered, then decided
      not to add the American pika under the US Endangered Species Act.[24] The original
      scientific name was Lepus (Lagomys) princeps.[18]\\\\nConservation and decline[edit]\\\\nAs
      they live in the high and cooler mountain regions, they are very sensitive to
      high temperatures, and are considered to be one of the best early warning systems
      for detecting global warming in the western United States.[19]\\\\nTemperature
      increases are suspected to be one cause of American pikas moving higher in elevation[20]
      in an attempt to find suitable habitat, as well as cooler temperatures. Distribution
      and habitat[edit]\\\\nThe American pika can be found throughout the mountains
      of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada
      to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
      Nevada, California, and New Mexico.[10] Of the 30 existing species of pika,
      it is one of only two which inhabit North America, along with the collared pika
      (O. collaris). The project concluded in 2016.[26]\\\\nMore recent studies have
      found widespread extirpations and range retractions at lower elevations which
      are typically warmer and drier, patterns that have been further attributed to
      varying aspects of climate change such as warmer summer and winter temperatures
      and changes in precipitation.[27][28][29][30] For example, one study found upslope
      retractions in 44 of 64 watersheds surveyed in the Northern Rockies, with retractions
      averaging 281\_m (922\_ft).[31] Although a pika can meet its water demand from
      the vegetation eaten, it does drink water if it is available in its environment.[14]\\\\nPikas
      have two different ways of foraging; they directly consume food (feeding) or
      they cache food in haypiles to use for a food source in the winter (haying).[11]
      They feed throughout the year while haying is limited to the summer.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\":
      \\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pika\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Pikas do not
      hibernate and remain active throughout the winter by traveling in tunnels under
      rocks and snow and eating dried plants that they have stored.[14] Rock-dwelling
      pikas exhibit two methods of foraging: the first involves direct consumption
      of food, and the second is characterized by the gathering of plants to store
      in a \\\\\\\"haypile\\\\\\\" of cached plants.[15]\\\\nThe impact of human activity
      on the tundra ecosystems where pikas live has been recorded dating back to the
      1970s.[16] Rather than hibernate during winter, pikas forage for grasses and
      other forms of plant matter and stash these findings in protected dens in a
      process called \\\\\\\"haying\\\\\\\".\\\\n Such interactions with humans have
      been linked to pikas having reduced amounts of foraging time, consequentially
      limiting the amount of food they can stockpile for winter months.[18] Pikas
      prefer foraging in temperatures below 25\_\xB0C (77\_\xB0F), so they generally
      spend their time in shaded regions and out of direct sunlight when temperatures
      are high.[18] A link has also been found between temperature increases and lost
      foraging time, where for every increase of 1\_\xB0C (1.8\_\xB0F) to the ambient
      temperature in alpine landscapes home to pikas, those pikas lose 3% of their
      foraging time.[18]\\\\nEurasian pikas commonly live in family groups and share
      duties of gathering food and keeping watch. Pleistocene fossils of the extant
      steppe pika O. pusilla currently native to Asia have been found also in many
      countries of Europe from the United Kingdom to Russia and from Italy to Poland,
      and the Asiatic extant northern pika O. hyperborea in one location in the middle
      Pleistocene United States.[1]\\\\nWhile Ochotona is the only currently living

      and extreme maximum surface temperatures in August at these sites are 32 and
      38\_\xB0C (90 and 100\_\xB0F), respectively.[22]\\nRecent studies suggest some
      populations are declining due to various factors, most notably global warming.[20]
      A 2003 study, published in the Journal of Mammalogy, showed nine of 25 sampled
      populations of American pika had been extirpated in the Great Basin, leading
      biologists to conduct further investigations to determine if the species as
      a whole is vulnerable.[23]\\nIn 2010, the US government considered, then decided
      not to add the American pika under the US Endangered Species Act.[24] The original
      scientific name was Lepus (Lagomys) princeps.[18]\\nConservation and decline[edit]\\nAs
      they live in the high and cooler mountain regions, they are very sensitive to
      high temperatures, and are considered to be one of the best early warning systems
      for detecting global warming in the western United States.[19]\\nTemperature
      increases are suspected to be one cause of American pikas moving higher in elevation[20]
      in an attempt to find suitable habitat, as well as cooler temperatures. Distribution
      and habitat[edit]\\nThe American pika can be found throughout the mountains
      of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada
      to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
      Nevada, California, and New Mexico.[10] Of the 30 existing species of pika,
      it is one of only two which inhabit North America, along with the collared pika
      (O. collaris). The project concluded in 2016.[26]\\nMore recent studies have
      found widespread extirpations and range retractions at lower elevations which
      are typically warmer and drier, patterns that have been further attributed to
      varying aspects of climate change such as warmer summer and winter temperatures
      and changes in precipitation.[27][28][29][30] For example, one study found upslope
      retractions in 44 of 64 watersheds surveyed in the Northern Rockies, with retractions
      averaging 281\_m (922\_ft).[31] Although a pika can meet its water demand from
      the vegetation eaten, it does drink water if it is available in its environment.[14]\\nPikas
      have two different ways of foraging; they directly consume food (feeding) or
      they cache food in haypiles to use for a food source in the winter (haying).[11]

      I\\\\nCharacteristics of sites in the hydrological Great Basin, western United
      States, used in relevant analyses, 1994\u20132008, as presented by Beever et
      al. (2011:Appendix V), with calculations of range retraction. In this review
      I 1) review the paleontological history of the American pika in North America;
      2) outline why pikas are an exceptional species to study with regard to environmental
      change; 3) summarize relevant information on the status of pikas across the
      species\u2019 range; 4) highlight aspects of the resiliency of pikas living
      in extreme environments; 5) review how relevant traits of pikas may be impacted
      by environmental change; and 6) present the current conservation status of the
      pika. The mechanistic climatic models of Mathewson et al. (2017) correctly predicted
      the prehistoric retrenchment of pikas in the Great Basin, as well as the current
      distribution of pikas, but failed to account for the presence of pikas at Craters
      of the Moon, Lava Beds National Monument, Newberry National Volcanic Monument,
      or along the Columbia River Gorge (and presumably also at Bodie and the Mono
      Craters; collectively \u201Coutlier sites\u201D). Meanwhile, the pattern of
      occupancy in the northern constellation of patches, while variable from year
      to year, was unchanged; in fact, the documented number of pikas in the north
      in our 2009 and 2010 surveys exceeded the number of pikas counted in the north
      in 1972 or 1977 (Smith and Nagy 2015). Characteristics of Pikas in Stressful
      Environments\\\\nOur understanding of the current distribution and local abundance
      of American pika populations is contingent on a thorough understanding of the
      natural history of the species, notably missing from most of the contemporary
      work on pikas involving regional surveys.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9475130/\\\",
      \\\"content\\\": \\\"Our observations in 2021 of pikas on the Noonday Mine,
      coupled with those of pika occupancy on the Red Cloud Mine and the Booker Consolidated
      shaft (Klingler,\_2017; Nichols et al.,\_2016), indicate that following nearly
      a decade of extirpated status, there have been multiple re\u2010colonization
      episodes from the northern constellation to the southern constellation.\\\\n2.2.
      Nichols et al.\_(2016, p. 167\u2013168) mention seeing a pika in 2015 at an
      undisclosed site 1.2\_km from \u201Cthe nearest occupied patch\u201D \u2013
      most likely the Red Cloud Mine, 400\u2009m from the Noonday Mine (thus, the
      contention earlier in Nichols et al.,\_2016 that the southern constellation
      was extirpated at that time was incorrect). Although we know of only one other
      occupied site at the south end of the Craters, the potential exists for other
      active pika sites near NMCR that could have been the source for the re\u2010colonization
      observed in 2021 \u2013 such as the apparently transient individual observed
      via our camera trap in 2018 (Millar & Hickman,\_2021). At the far north end
      of the Mono Craters, 7\_km from the Pumice Mine site, Millar (Millar & Hickman,\_2021;
      Millar et al.,\_2013; C. I. Millar, unpublished observations) has been monitoring

      Figures\_1c and \u200Band2c).2c). C. I. Millar (unpublished surveys) has extensively
      explored talus habitat throughout the Mono Craters since 2009 using widely accepted
      methods for evaluating occupancy as follows: current occupancy of a talus (pika
      seen or heard and/or presence of current\u2010year haypile vegetation), former
      occupancy (only old haypile vegetation or dried, decomposing fecal pellets),
      or no indication of occupancy (none of these signs; Beever et al.,\_2003; Jeffress

      of sites in the hydrological Great Basin, western United States, used in relevant
      analyses, 1994\u20132008, as presented by Beever et al. (2011:Appendix V), with
      calculations of range retraction. In this review I 1) review the paleontological
      history of the American pika in North America; 2) outline why pikas are an exceptional
      species to study with regard to environmental change; 3) summarize relevant
      information on the status of pikas across the species\u2019 range; 4) highlight
      aspects of the resiliency of pikas living in extreme environments; 5) review
      how relevant traits of pikas may be impacted by environmental change; and 6)
      present the current conservation status of the pika. The mechanistic climatic
      models of Mathewson et al. (2017) correctly predicted the prehistoric retrenchment
      of pikas in the Great Basin, as well as the current distribution of pikas, but
      failed to account for the presence of pikas at Craters of the Moon, Lava Beds
      National Monument, Newberry National Volcanic Monument, or along the Columbia
      River Gorge (and presumably also at Bodie and the Mono Craters; collectively
      \u201Coutlier sites\u201D). Meanwhile, the pattern of occupancy in the northern
      constellation of patches, while variable from year to year, was unchanged; in
      fact, the documented number of pikas in the north in our 2009 and 2010 surveys
      exceeded the number of pikas counted in the north in 1972 or 1977 (Smith and
      Nagy 2015). Characteristics of Pikas in Stressful Environments\\nOur understanding
      of the current distribution and local abundance of American pika populations
      is contingent on a thorough understanding of the natural history of the species,
      notably missing from most of the contemporary work on pikas involving regional
      surveys.\",\"score\":0.9558167,\"raw_content\":null},{\"title\":\"Return of

      and extreme maximum surface temperatures in August at these sites are 32 and
      38\_\xB0C (90 and 100\_\xB0F), respectively.[22]\\\\nRecent studies suggest
      some populations are declining due to various factors, most notably global warming.[20]
      A 2003 study, published in the Journal of Mammalogy, showed nine of 25 sampled
      populations of American pika had been extirpated in the Great Basin, leading
      biologists to conduct further investigations to determine if the species as
      a whole is vulnerable.[23]\\\\nIn 2010, the US government considered, then decided
      not to add the American pika under the US Endangered Species Act.[24] The original
      scientific name was Lepus (Lagomys) princeps.[18]\\\\nConservation and decline[edit]\\\\nAs
      they live in the high and cooler mountain regions, they are very sensitive to
      high temperatures, and are considered to be one of the best early warning systems
      for detecting global warming in the western United States.[19]\\\\nTemperature
      increases are suspected to be one cause of American pikas moving higher in elevation[20]
      in an attempt to find suitable habitat, as well as cooler temperatures. Distribution
      and habitat[edit]\\\\nThe American pika can be found throughout the mountains
      of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada
      to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
      Nevada, California, and New Mexico.[10] Of the 30 existing species of pika,
      it is one of only two which inhabit North America, along with the collared pika
      (O. collaris). The project concluded in 2016.[26]\\\\nMore recent studies have
      found widespread extirpations and range retractions at lower elevations which
      are typically warmer and drier, patterns that have been further attributed to
      varying aspects of climate change such as warmer summer and winter temperatures
      and changes in precipitation.[27][28][29][30] For example, one study found upslope
      retractions in 44 of 64 watersheds surveyed in the Northern Rockies, with retractions
      averaging 281\_m (922\_ft).[31] Although a pika can meet its water demand from
      the vegetation eaten, it does drink water if it is available in its environment.[14]\\\\nPikas
      have two different ways of foraging; they directly consume food (feeding) or
      they cache food in haypiles to use for a food source in the winter (haying).[11]
      They feed throughout the year while haying is limited to the summer.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\":
      \\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pika\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Pikas do not
      hibernate and remain active throughout the winter by traveling in tunnels under
      rocks and snow and eating dried plants that they have stored.[14] Rock-dwelling
      pikas exhibit two methods of foraging: the first involves direct consumption
      of food, and the second is characterized by the gathering of plants to store
      in a \\\\\\\"haypile\\\\\\\" of cached plants.[15]\\\\nThe impact of human activity
      on the tundra ecosystems where pikas live has been recorded dating back to the
      1970s.[16] Rather than hibernate during winter, pikas forage for grasses and
      other forms of plant matter and stash these findings in protected dens in a
      process called \\\\\\\"haying\\\\\\\".\\\\n Such interactions with humans have
      been linked to pikas having reduced amounts of foraging time, consequentially
      limiting the amount of food they can stockpile for winter months.[18] Pikas
      prefer foraging in temperatures below 25\_\xB0C (77\_\xB0F), so they generally
      spend their time in shaded regions and out of direct sunlight when temperatures
      are high.[18] A link has also been found between temperature increases and lost
      foraging time, where for every increase of 1\_\xB0C (1.8\_\xB0F) to the ambient
      temperature in alpine landscapes home to pikas, those pikas lose 3% of their
      foraging time.[18]\\\\nEurasian pikas commonly live in family groups and share
      duties of gathering food and keeping watch. Pleistocene fossils of the extant
      steppe pika O. pusilla currently native to Asia have been found also in many
      countries of Europe from the United Kingdom to Russia and from Italy to Poland,
      and the Asiatic extant northern pika O. hyperborea in one location in the middle
      Pleistocene United States.[1]\\\\nWhile Ochotona is the only currently living
      genus of Ochotonidae, extinct genera of ochotonids include\\\\n\u2020Albertona,

      in the Ochotonidae, sometimes in Leporidae or in neither ochotonid nor leporid
      stem-lagomorphs.[36]\\\\nOchotonids appeared in Asia between the late Eocene
      and the early Oligocene, and continued to develop along with increased distribution
      of C3 grasses in previously forest dominated areas under the \\\\\\\"climatic
      optimum\\\\\\\" from the late Oligocene to middle Miocene. The North American
      collared pika (O. collaris) and American pika (O. princeps) have been suggested
      to have descended from the same ancestor as the steppe pika (O. pusilla).[25]\\\\nThe

      1970s.[16] Rather than hibernate during winter, pikas forage for grasses and
      other forms of plant matter and stash these findings in protected dens in a
      process called \\\"haying\\\".\\n Such interactions with humans have been linked
      to pikas having reduced amounts of foraging time, consequentially limiting the
      amount of food they can stockpile for winter months.[18] Pikas prefer foraging
      in temperatures below 25\_\xB0C (77\_\xB0F), so they generally spend their time
      in shaded regions and out of direct sunlight when temperatures are high.[18]
      A link has also been found between temperature increases and lost foraging time,
      where for every increase of 1\_\xB0C (1.8\_\xB0F) to the ambient temperature
      in alpine landscapes home to pikas, those pikas lose 3% of their foraging time.[18]\\nEurasian
      pikas commonly live in family groups and share duties of gathering food and
      keeping watch. Pleistocene fossils of the extant steppe pika O. pusilla currently
      native to Asia have been found also in many countries of Europe from the United
      Kingdom to Russia and from Italy to Poland, and the Asiatic extant northern
      pika O. hyperborea in one location in the middle Pleistocene United States.[1]\\nWhile
      Ochotona is the only currently living genus of Ochotonidae, extinct genera of
      ochotonids include\\n\u2020Albertona, \u2020Alloptox, \u2020Amphilagus, \u2020Australagomys,
      \u2020Austrolagomys, \u2020Bellatona, \u2020Bellatonoides, \u2020Bohlinotona,

      \u2020Russellagus, \u2020Sinolagomys and \u2020Titanomys.[1] The earliest one
      is Desmatolagus (middle Eocene to Miocene, 42.5\u201314.8 Ma[1]), usually included
      in the Ochotonidae, sometimes in Leporidae or in neither ochotonid nor leporid
      stem-lagomorphs.[36]\\nOchotonids appeared in Asia between the late Eocene and
      the early Oligocene, and continued to develop along with increased distribution
      of C3 grasses in previously forest dominated areas under the \\\"climatic optimum\\\"
      from the late Oligocene to middle Miocene. The North American collared pika
      (O. collaris) and American pika (O. princeps) have been suggested to have descended
      from the same ancestor as the steppe pika (O. pusilla).[25]\\nThe range of Ochotona
      was larger in the past, with both extinct and extant species inhabiting Western
      Europe and Eastern North America, areas that are currently free of pikas.\",\"score\":0.9145963,\"raw_content\":null},{\"title\":\"Pikas

      A 2003 study, published in the Journal of Mammalogy, showed nine of 25 sampled

      they live in the high and cooler mountain regions, they are very sensitive to

      for detecting global warming in the western United States.[19]\\\\nTemperature
      increases are suspected to be one cause of American pikas moving higher in elevation[20]

      of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada
      to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
      Nevada, California, and New Mexico.[10] Of the 30 existing species of pika,
      it is one of only two which inhabit North America, along with the collared pika

      and changes in precipitation.[27][28][29][30] For example, one study found upslope

      I\\\\nCharacteristics of sites in the hydrological Great Basin, western United
      States, used in relevant analyses, 1994\u20132008, as presented by Beever et
      al. (2011:Appendix V), with calculations of range retraction. In this review
      I 1) review the paleontological history of the American pika in North America;
      2) outline why pikas are an exceptional species to study with regard to environmental
      change; 3) summarize relevant information on the status of pikas across the
      species\u2019 range; 4) highlight aspects of the resiliency of pikas living
      in extreme environments; 5) review how relevant traits of pikas may be impacted
      by environmental change; and 6) present the current conservation status of the
      pika. The mechanistic climatic models of Mathewson et al. (2017) correctly predicted
      the prehistoric retrenchment of pikas in the Great Basin, as well as the current
      distribution of pikas, but failed to account for the presence of pikas at Craters
      of the Moon, Lava Beds National Monument, Newberry National Volcanic Monument,
      or along the Columbia River Gorge (and presumably also at Bodie and the Mono
      Craters; collectively \u201Coutlier sites\u201D). Meanwhile, the pattern of
      occupancy in the northern constellation of patches, while variable from year
      to year, was unchanged; in fact, the documented number of pikas in the north
      in our 2009 and 2010 surveys exceeded the number of pikas counted in the north
      in 1972 or 1977 (Smith and Nagy 2015). Characteristics of Pikas in Stressful
      Environments\\\\nOur understanding of the current distribution and local abundance
      of American pika populations is contingent on a thorough understanding of the
      natural history of the species, notably missing from most of the contemporary
      work on pikas involving regional surveys.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9475130/\\\",
      \\\"content\\\": \\\"Our observations in 2021 of pikas on the Noonday Mine,
      coupled with those of pika occupancy on the Red Cloud Mine and the Booker Consolidated
      shaft (Klingler,\_2017; Nichols et al.,\_2016), indicate that following nearly
      a decade of extirpated status, there have been multiple re\u2010colonization
      episodes from the northern constellation to the southern constellation.\\\\n2.2.
      Nichols et al.\_(2016, p. 167\u2013168) mention seeing a pika in 2015 at an

      most likely the Red Cloud Mine, 400\u2009m from the Noonday Mine (thus, the
      contention earlier in Nichols et al.,\_2016 that the southern constellation
      was extirpated at that time was incorrect). Although we know of only one other
      occupied site at the south end of the Craters, the potential exists for other
      active pika sites near NMCR that could have been the source for the re\u2010colonization
      observed in 2021 \u2013 such as the apparently transient individual observed
      via our camera trap in 2018 (Millar & Hickman,\_2021). At the far north end
      of the Mono Craters, 7\_km from the Pumice Mine site, Millar (Millar & Hickman,\_2021;

      Figures\_1c and \u200Band2c).2c). C. I. Millar (unpublished surveys) has extensively
      explored talus habitat throughout the Mono Craters since 2009 using widely accepted
      methods for evaluating occupancy as follows: current occupancy of a talus (pika
      seen or heard and/or presence of current\u2010year haypile vegetation), former
      occupancy (only old haypile vegetation or dried, decomposing fecal pellets),
      or no indication of occupancy (none of these signs; Beever et al.,\_2003; Jeffress

      and extreme maximum surface temperatures in August at these sites are 32 and
      38\_\xB0C (90 and 100\_\xB0F), respectively.[22]\\\\nRecent studies suggest
      some populations are declining due to various factors, most notably global warming.[20]
      A 2003 study, published in the Journal of Mammalogy, showed nine of 25 sampled
      populations of American pika had been extirpated in the Great Basin, leading
      biologists to conduct further investigations to determine if the species as
      a whole is vulnerable.[23]\\\\nIn 2010, the US government considered, then decided
      not to add the American pika under the US Endangered Species Act.[24] The original
      scientific name was Lepus (Lagomys) princeps.[18]\\\\nConservation and decline[edit]\\\\nAs
      they live in the high and cooler mountain regions, they are very sensitive to
      high temperatures, and are considered to be one of the best early warning systems
      for detecting global warming in the western United States.[19]\\\\nTemperature
      increases are suspected to be one cause of American pikas moving higher in elevation[20]
      in an attempt to find suitable habitat, as well as cooler temperatures. Distribution
      and habitat[edit]\\\\nThe American pika can be found throughout the mountains
      of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada
      to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
      Nevada, California, and New Mexico.[10] Of the 30 existing species of pika,
      it is one of only two which inhabit North America, along with the collared pika
      (O. collaris). The project concluded in 2016.[26]\\\\nMore recent studies have
      found widespread extirpations and range retractions at lower elevations which
      are typically warmer and drier, patterns that have been further attributed to
      varying aspects of climate change such as warmer summer and winter temperatures
      and changes in precipitation.[27][28][29][30] For example, one study found upslope
      retractions in 44 of 64 watersheds surveyed in the Northern Rockies, with retractions
      averaging 281\_m (922\_ft).[31] Although a pika can meet its water demand from
      the vegetation eaten, it does drink water if it is available in its environment.[14]\\\\nPikas
      have two different ways of foraging; they directly consume food (feeding) or
      they cache food in haypiles to use for a food source in the winter (haying).[11]
      They feed throughout the year while haying is limited to the summer.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\":
      \\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pika\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Pikas do not
      hibernate and remain active throughout the winter by traveling in tunnels under
      rocks and snow and eating dried plants that they have stored.[14] Rock-dwelling
      pikas exhibit two methods of foraging: the first involves direct consumption
      of food, and the second is characterized by the gathering of plants to store
      in a \\\\\\\"haypile\\\\\\\" of cached plants.[15]\\\\nThe impact of human activity
      on the tundra ecosystems where pikas live has been recorded dating back to the
      1970s.[16] Rather than hibernate during winter, pikas forage for grasses and
      other forms of plant matter and stash these findings in protected dens in a
      process called \\\\\\\"haying\\\\\\\".\\\\n Such interactions with humans have
      been linked to pikas having reduced amounts of foraging time, consequentially
      limiting the amount of food they can stockpile for winter months.[18] Pikas
      prefer foraging in temperatures below 25\_\xB0C (77\_\xB0F), so they generally
      spend their time in shaded regions and out of direct sunlight when temperatures
      are high.[18] A link has also been found between temperature increases and lost
      foraging time, where for every increase of 1\_\xB0C (1.8\_\xB0F) to the ambient
      temperature in alpine landscapes home to pikas, those pikas lose 3% of their
      foraging time.[18]\\\\nEurasian pikas commonly live in family groups and share
      duties of gathering food and keeping watch. Pleistocene fossils of the extant
      steppe pika O. pusilla currently native to Asia have been found also in many
      countries of Europe from the United Kingdom to Russia and from Italy to Poland,
      and the Asiatic extant northern pika O. hyperborea in one location in the middle
      Pleistocene United States.[1]\\\\nWhile Ochotona is the only currently living
      genus of Ochotonidae, extinct genera of ochotonids include\\\\n\u2020Albertona,

      is Desmatolagus (middle Eocene to Miocene, 42.5\u201314.8 Ma[1]), usually included
      in the Ochotonidae, sometimes in Leporidae or in neither ochotonid nor leporid
      stem-lagomorphs.[36]\\\\nOchotonids appeared in Asia between the late Eocene
      and the early Oligocene, and continued to develop along with increased distribution
      of C3 grasses in previously forest dominated areas under the \\\\\\\"climatic
      optimum\\\\\\\" from the late Oligocene to middle Miocene. The North American
      collared pika (O. collaris) and American pika (O. princeps) have been suggested
      to have descended from the same ancestor as the steppe pika (O. pusilla).[25]\\\\nThe

      I\\\\nCharacteristics of sites in the hydrological Great Basin, western United
      States, used in relevant analyses, 1994\u20132008, as presented by Beever et
      al. (2011:Appendix V), with calculations of range retraction. In this review
      I 1) review the paleontological history of the American pika in North America;
      2) outline why pikas are an exceptional species to study with regard to environmental
      change; 3) summarize relevant information on the status of pikas across the
      species\u2019 range; 4) highlight aspects of the resiliency of pikas living
      in extreme environments; 5) review how relevant traits of pikas may be impacted
      by environmental change; and 6) present the current conservation status of the
      pika. The mechanistic climatic models of Mathewson et al. (2017) correctly predicted
      the prehistoric retrenchment of pikas in the Great Basin, as well as the current
      distribution of pikas, but failed to account for the presence of pikas at Craters
      of the Moon, Lava Beds National Monument, Newberry National Volcanic Monument,
      or along the Columbia River Gorge (and presumably also at Bodie and the Mono
      Craters; collectively \u201Coutlier sites\u201D). Meanwhile, the pattern of
      occupancy in the northern constellation of patches, while variable from year
      to year, was unchanged; in fact, the documented number of pikas in the north
      in our 2009 and 2010 surveys exceeded the number of pikas counted in the north
      in 1972 or 1977 (Smith and Nagy 2015). Characteristics of Pikas in Stressful
      Environments\\\\nOur understanding of the current distribution and local abundance
      of American pika populations is contingent on a thorough understanding of the
      natural history of the species, notably missing from most of the contemporary
      work on pikas involving regional surveys.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9475130/\\\",
      \\\"content\\\": \\\"Our observations in 2021 of pikas on the Noonday Mine,
      coupled with those of pika occupancy on the Red Cloud Mine and the Booker Consolidated
      shaft (Klingler,\_2017; Nichols et al.,\_2016), indicate that following nearly
      a decade of extirpated status, there have been multiple re\u2010colonization
      episodes from the northern constellation to the southern constellation.\\\\n2.2.
      Nichols et al.\_(2016, p. 167\u2013168) mention seeing a pika in 2015 at an
      undisclosed site 1.2\_km from \u201Cthe nearest occupied patch\u201D \u2013
      most likely the Red Cloud Mine, 400\u2009m from the Noonday Mine (thus, the
      contention earlier in Nichols et al.,\_2016 that the southern constellation
      was extirpated at that time was incorrect). Although we know of only one other

      calculations of range retraction. In this review I 1) review the paleontological
      history of the American pika in North America; 2) outline why pikas are an exceptional
      species to study with regard to environmental change; 3) summarize relevant
      information on the status of pikas across the species\u2019 range; 4) highlight
      aspects of the resiliency of pikas living in extreme environments; 5) review
      how relevant traits of pikas may be impacted by environmental change; and 6)
      present the current conservation status of the pika. The mechanistic climatic
      models of Mathewson et al. (2017) correctly predicted the prehistoric retrenchment
      of pikas in the Great Basin, as well as the current distribution of pikas, but
      failed to account for the presence of pikas at Craters of the Moon, Lava Beds
      National Monument, Newberry National Volcanic Monument, or along the Columbia
      River Gorge (and presumably also at Bodie and the Mono Craters; collectively
      \u201Coutlier sites\u201D). Meanwhile, the pattern of occupancy in the northern
      constellation of patches, while variable from year to year, was unchanged; in
      fact, the documented number of pikas in the north in our 2009 and 2010 surveys
      exceeded the number of pikas counted in the north in 1972 or 1977 (Smith and
      Nagy 2015). Characteristics of Pikas in Stressful Environments\\nOur understanding
      of the current distribution and local abundance of American pika populations

      38\_\xB0C (90 and 100\_\xB0F), respectively.[22]\\\\nRecent studies suggest
      some populations are declining due to various factors, most notably global warming.[20]
      A 2003 study, published in the Journal of Mammalogy, showed nine of 25 sampled
      populations of American pika had been extirpated in the Great Basin, leading
      biologists to conduct further investigations to determine if the species as
      a whole is vulnerable.[23]\\\\nIn 2010, the US government considered, then decided
      not to add the American pika under the US Endangered Species Act.[24] The original
      scientific name was Lepus (Lagomys) princeps.[18]\\\\nConservation and decline[edit]\\\\nAs
      they live in the high and cooler mountain regions, they are very sensitive to
      high temperatures, and are considered to be one of the best early warning systems
      for detecting global warming in the western United States.[19]\\\\nTemperature
      increases are suspected to be one cause of American pikas moving higher in elevation[20]
      in an attempt to find suitable habitat, as well as cooler temperatures. Distribution
      and habitat[edit]\\\\nThe American pika can be found throughout the mountains
      of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada
      to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
      Nevada, California, and New Mexico.[10] Of the 30 existing species of pika,
      it is one of only two which inhabit North America, along with the collared pika
      (O. collaris). The project concluded in 2016.[26]\\\\nMore recent studies have
      found widespread extirpations and range retractions at lower elevations which
      are typically warmer and drier, patterns that have been further attributed to
      varying aspects of climate change such as warmer summer and winter temperatures
      and changes in precipitation.[27][28][29][30] For example, one study found upslope
      retractions in 44 of 64 watersheds surveyed in the Northern Rockies, with retractions
      averaging 281\_m (922\_ft).[31] Although a pika can meet its water demand from
      the vegetation eaten, it does drink water if it is available in its environment.[14]\\\\nPikas
      have two different ways of foraging; they directly consume food (feeding) or
      they cache food in haypiles to use for a food source in the winter (haying).[11]
      They feed throughout the year while haying is limited to the summer.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\":
      \\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pika\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Pikas do not
      hibernate and remain active throughout the winter by traveling in tunnels under
      rocks and snow and eating dried plants that they have stored.[14] Rock-dwelling
      pikas exhibit two methods of foraging: the first involves direct consumption
      of food, and the second is characterized by the gathering of plants to store
      in a \\\\\\\"haypile\\\\\\\" of cached plants.[15]\\\\nThe impact of human activity
      on the tundra ecosystems where pikas live has been recorded dating back to the
      1970s.[16] Rather than hibernate during winter, pikas forage for grasses and
      other forms of plant matter and stash these findings in protected dens in a
      process called \\\\\\\"haying\\\\\\\".\\\\n Such interactions with humans have
      been linked to pikas having reduced amounts of foraging time, consequentially
      limiting the amount of food they can stockpile for winter months.[18] Pikas
      prefer foraging in temperatures below 25\_\xB0C (77\_\xB0F), so they generally
      spend their time in shaded regions and out of direct sunlight when temperatures
      are high.[18] A link has also been found between temperature increases and lost
      foraging time, where for every increase of 1\_\xB0C (1.8\_\xB0F) to the ambient
      temperature in alpine landscapes home to pikas, those pikas lose 3% of their
      foraging time.[18]\\\\nEurasian pikas commonly live in family groups and share
      duties of gathering food and keeping watch. Pleistocene fossils of the extant
      steppe pika O. pusilla currently native to Asia have been found also in many
      countries of Europe from the United Kingdom to Russia and from Italy to Poland,
      and the Asiatic extant northern pika O. hyperborea in one location in the middle
      Pleistocene United States.[1]\\\\nWhile Ochotona is the only currently living
      genus of Ochotonidae, extinct genera of ochotonids include\\\\n\u2020Albertona,

      is Desmatolagus (middle Eocene to Miocene, 42.5\u201314.8 Ma[1]), usually included
      in the Ochotonidae, sometimes in Leporidae or in neither ochotonid nor leporid
      stem-lagomorphs.[36]\\\\nOchotonids appeared in Asia between the late Eocene
      and the early Oligocene, and continued to develop along with increased distribution
      of C3 grasses in previously forest dominated areas under the \\\\\\\"climatic
      optimum\\\\\\\" from the late Oligocene to middle Miocene. The North American
      collared pika (O. collaris) and American pika (O. princeps) have been suggested
      to have descended from the same ancestor as the steppe pika (O. pusilla).[25]\\\\nThe

      inhabiting Western Europe and Eastern North America, areas that are currently

      and extreme maximum surface temperatures in August at these sites are 32 and
      38\_\xB0C (90 and 100\_\xB0F), respectively.[22]\\nRecent studies suggest some
      populations are declining due to various factors, most notably global warming.[20]
      A 2003 study, published in the Journal of Mammalogy, showed nine of 25 sampled
      populations of American pika had been extirpated in the Great Basin, leading
      biologists to conduct further investigations to determine if the species as
      a whole is vulnerable.[23]\\nIn 2010, the US government considered, then decided
      not to add the American pika under the US Endangered Species Act.[24] The original
      scientific name was Lepus (Lagomys) princeps.[18]\\nConservation and decline[edit]\\nAs
      they live in the high and cooler mountain regions, they are very sensitive to
      high temperatures, and are considered to be one of the best early warning systems
      for detecting global warming in the western United States.[19]\\nTemperature
      increases are suspected to be one cause of American pikas moving higher in elevation[20]
      in an attempt to find suitable habitat, as well as cooler temperatures. Distribution
      and habitat[edit]\\nThe American pika can be found throughout the mountains
      of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada
      to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
      Nevada, California, and New Mexico.[10] Of the 30 existing species of pika,
      it is one of only two which inhabit North America, along with the collared pika
      (O. collaris). The project concluded in 2016.[26]\\nMore recent studies have
      found widespread extirpations and range retractions at lower elevations which
      are typically warmer and drier, patterns that have been further attributed to
      varying aspects of climate change such as warmer summer and winter temperatures
      and changes in precipitation.[27][28][29][30] For example, one study found upslope
      retractions in 44 of 64 watersheds surveyed in the Northern Rockies, with retractions
      averaging 281\_m (922\_ft).[31] Although a pika can meet its water demand from
      the vegetation eaten, it does drink water if it is available in its environment.[14]\\nPikas
      have two different ways of foraging; they directly consume food (feeding) or
      they cache food in haypiles to use for a food source in the winter (haying).[11]
      They feed throughout the year while haying is limited to the summer.\",\"score\":0.9972316,\"raw_content\":null},{\"title\":\"Pika
      - Wikipedia\",\"url\":\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pika\",\"content\":\"Pikas
      do not hibernate and remain active throughout the winter by traveling in tunnels
      under rocks and snow and eating dried plants that they have stored.[14] Rock-dwelling
      pikas exhibit two methods of foraging: the first involves direct consumption
      of food, and the second is characterized by the gathering of plants to store
      in a \\\"haypile\\\" of cached plants.[15]\\nThe impact of human activity on
      the tundra ecosystems where pikas live has been recorded dating back to the
      1970s.[16] Rather than hibernate during winter, pikas forage for grasses and
      other forms of plant matter and stash these findings in protected dens in a
      process called \\\"haying\\\".\\n Such interactions with humans have been linked
      to pikas having reduced amounts of foraging time, consequentially limiting the
      amount of food they can stockpile for winter months.[18] Pikas prefer foraging
      in temperatures below 25\_\xB0C (77\_\xB0F), so they generally spend their time
      in shaded regions and out of direct sunlight when temperatures are high.[18]
      A link has also been found between temperature increases and lost foraging time,
      where for every increase of 1\_\xB0C (1.8\_\xB0F) to the ambient temperature
      in alpine landscapes home to pikas, those pikas lose 3% of their foraging time.[18]\\nEurasian
      pikas commonly live in family groups and share duties of gathering food and
      keeping watch. Pleistocene fossils of the extant steppe pika O. pusilla currently
      native to Asia have been found also in many countries of Europe from the United
      Kingdom to Russia and from Italy to Poland, and the Asiatic extant northern
      pika O. hyperborea in one location in the middle Pleistocene United States.[1]\\nWhile
      Ochotona is the only currently living genus of Ochotonidae, extinct genera of
      ochotonids include\\n\u2020Albertona, \u2020Alloptox, \u2020Amphilagus, \u2020Australagomys,

      \u2020Russellagus, \u2020Sinolagomys and \u2020Titanomys.[1] The earliest one
      is Desmatolagus (middle Eocene to Miocene, 42.5\u201314.8 Ma[1]), usually included
      in the Ochotonidae, sometimes in Leporidae or in neither ochotonid nor leporid
      stem-lagomorphs.[36]\\nOchotonids appeared in Asia between the late Eocene and
      the early Oligocene, and continued to develop along with increased distribution
      of C3 grasses in previously forest dominated areas under the \\\"climatic optimum\\\"
      from the late Oligocene to middle Miocene. The North American collared pika
      (O. collaris) and American pika (O. princeps) have been suggested to have descended
      from the same ancestor as the steppe pika (O. pusilla).[25]\\nThe range of Ochotona
      was larger in the past, with both extinct and extant species inhabiting Western
      Europe and Eastern North America, areas that are currently free of pikas.\",\"score\":0.9145963,\"raw_content\":null},{\"title\":\"Pikas

      I\\\\nCharacteristics of sites in the hydrological Great Basin, western United
      States, used in relevant analyses, 1994\u20132008, as presented by Beever et
      al. (2011:Appendix V), with calculations of range retraction. In this review
      I 1) review the paleontological history of the American pika in North America;
      2) outline why pikas are an exceptional species to study with regard to environmental
      change; 3) summarize relevant information on the status of pikas across the
      species\u2019 range; 4) highlight aspects of the resiliency of pikas living
      in extreme environments; 5) review how relevant traits of pikas may be impacted
      by environmental change; and 6) present the current conservation status of the
      pika. The mechanistic climatic models of Mathewson et al. (2017) correctly predicted
      the prehistoric retrenchment of pikas in the Great Basin, as well as the current
      distribution of pikas, but failed to account for the presence of pikas at Craters
      of the Moon, Lava Beds National Monument, Newberry National Volcanic Monument,
      or along the Columbia River Gorge (and presumably also at Bodie and the Mono
      Craters; collectively \u201Coutlier sites\u201D). Meanwhile, the pattern of
      occupancy in the northern constellation of patches, while variable from year
      to year, was unchanged; in fact, the documented number of pikas in the north
      in our 2009 and 2010 surveys exceeded the number of pikas counted in the north
      in 1972 or 1977 (Smith and Nagy 2015). Characteristics of Pikas in Stressful
      Environments\\\\nOur understanding of the current distribution and local abundance
      of American pika populations is contingent on a thorough understanding of the
      natural history of the species, notably missing from most of the contemporary
      work on pikas involving regional surveys.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9475130/\\\",
      \\\"content\\\": \\\"Our observations in 2021 of pikas on the Noonday Mine,
      coupled with those of pika occupancy on the Red Cloud Mine and the Booker Consolidated
      shaft (Klingler,\_2017; Nichols et al.,\_2016), indicate that following nearly
      a decade of extirpated status, there have been multiple re\u2010colonization
      episodes from the northern constellation to the southern constellation.\\\\n2.2.
      Nichols et al.\_(2016, p. 167\u2013168) mention seeing a pika in 2015 at an
      undisclosed site 1.2\_km from \u201Cthe nearest occupied patch\u201D \u2013
      most likely the Red Cloud Mine, 400\u2009m from the Noonday Mine (thus, the
      contention earlier in Nichols et al.,\_2016 that the southern constellation
      was extirpated at that time was incorrect). Although we know of only one other
      occupied site at the south end of the Craters, the potential exists for other
      active pika sites near NMCR that could have been the source for the re\u2010colonization
      observed in 2021 \u2013 such as the apparently transient individual observed
      via our camera trap in 2018 (Millar & Hickman,\_2021). At the far north end
      of the Mono Craters, 7\_km from the Pumice Mine site, Millar (Millar & Hickman,\_2021;

      Figures\_1c and \u200Band2c).2c). C. I. Millar (unpublished surveys) has extensively
      explored talus habitat throughout the Mono Craters since 2009 using widely accepted
      methods for evaluating occupancy as follows: current occupancy of a talus (pika
      seen or heard and/or presence of current\u2010year haypile vegetation), former
      occupancy (only old haypile vegetation or dried, decomposing fecal pellets),
      or no indication of occupancy (none of these signs; Beever et al.,\_2003; Jeffress

      of sites in the hydrological Great Basin, western United States, used in relevant
      analyses, 1994\u20132008, as presented by Beever et al. (2011:Appendix V), with
      calculations of range retraction. In this review I 1) review the paleontological
      history of the American pika in North America; 2) outline why pikas are an exceptional
      species to study with regard to environmental change; 3) summarize relevant
      information on the status of pikas across the species\u2019 range; 4) highlight
      aspects of the resiliency of pikas living in extreme environments; 5) review
      how relevant traits of pikas may be impacted by environmental change; and 6)
      present the current conservation status of the pika. The mechanistic climatic
      models of Mathewson et al. (2017) correctly predicted the prehistoric retrenchment
      of pikas in the Great Basin, as well as the current distribution of pikas, but
      failed to account for the presence of pikas at Craters of the Moon, Lava Beds
      National Monument, Newberry National Volcanic Monument, or along the Columbia
      River Gorge (and presumably also at Bodie and the Mono Craters; collectively
      \u201Coutlier sites\u201D). Meanwhile, the pattern of occupancy in the northern
      constellation of patches, while variable from year to year, was unchanged; in
      fact, the documented number of pikas in the north in our 2009 and 2010 surveys
      exceeded the number of pikas counted in the north in 1972 or 1977 (Smith and
      Nagy 2015). Characteristics of Pikas in Stressful Environments\\nOur understanding
      of the current distribution and local abundance of American pika populations
      is contingent on a thorough understanding of the natural history of the species,
      notably missing from most of the contemporary work on pikas involving regional
      surveys.\",\"score\":0.9558167,\"raw_content\":null},{\"title\":\"Return of
      the pika: American pikas re\u2010occupy long\u2010extirpated, warm ...\",\"url\":\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9475130/\",\"content\":\"Our
      observations in 2021 of pikas on the Noonday Mine, coupled with those of pika
      occupancy on the Red Cloud Mine and the Booker Consolidated shaft (Klingler,\_2017;
      Nichols et al.,\_2016), indicate that following nearly a decade of extirpated
      status, there have been multiple re\u2010colonization episodes from the northern
      constellation to the southern constellation.\\n2.2. Nichols et al.\_(2016, p.
      167\u2013168) mention seeing a pika in 2015 at an undisclosed site 1.2\_km from
      \u201Cthe nearest occupied patch\u201D \u2013 most likely the Red Cloud Mine,
      400\u2009m from the Noonday Mine (thus, the contention earlier in Nichols et
      al.,\_2016 that the southern constellation was extirpated at that time was incorrect).
      Although we know of only one other occupied site at the south end of the Craters,
      the potential exists for other active pika sites near NMCR that could have been
      the source for the re\u2010colonization observed in 2021 \u2013 such as the
      apparently transient individual observed via our camera trap in 2018 (Millar
      & Hickman,\_2021). At the far north end of the Mono Craters, 7\_km from the
      Pumice Mine site, Millar (Millar & Hickman,\_2021; Millar et al.,\_2013; C.
      I. Millar, unpublished observations) has been monitoring the presence of pika
      sites since 2011 (North Mono Craters, NMCR; 2092\u20132260\u2009m; Figures\_1c
      and \u200Band2c).2c). C. I. Millar (unpublished surveys) has extensively explored
      talus habitat throughout the Mono Craters since 2009 using widely accepted methods
      for evaluating occupancy as follows: current occupancy of a talus (pika seen
      or heard and/or presence of current\u2010year haypile vegetation), former occupancy
      (only old haypile vegetation or dried, decomposing fecal pellets), or no indication
      of occupancy (none of these signs; Beever et al.,\_2003; Jeffress et al.,\_2017;

      and extreme maximum surface temperatures in August at these sites are 32 and
      38\_\xB0C (90 and 100\_\xB0F), respectively.[22]\\\\nRecent studies suggest
      some populations are declining due to various factors, most notably global warming.[20]
      A 2003 study, published in the Journal of Mammalogy, showed nine of 25 sampled
      populations of American pika had been extirpated in the Great Basin, leading
      biologists to conduct further investigations to determine if the species as
      a whole is vulnerable.[23]\\\\nIn 2010, the US government considered, then decided
      not to add the American pika under the US Endangered Species Act.[24] The original
      scientific name was Lepus (Lagomys) princeps.[18]\\\\nConservation and decline[edit]\\\\nAs
      they live in the high and cooler mountain regions, they are very sensitive to
      high temperatures, and are considered to be one of the best early warning systems
      for detecting global warming in the western United States.[19]\\\\nTemperature
      increases are suspected to be one cause of American pikas moving higher in elevation[20]
      in an attempt to find suitable habitat, as well as cooler temperatures. Distribution
      and habitat[edit]\\\\nThe American pika can be found throughout the mountains
      of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada
      to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
      Nevada, California, and New Mexico.[10] Of the 30 existing species of pika,
      it is one of only two which inhabit North America, along with the collared pika
      (O. collaris). The project concluded in 2016.[26]\\\\nMore recent studies have
      found widespread extirpations and range retractions at lower elevations which
      are typically warmer and drier, patterns that have been further attributed to
      varying aspects of climate change such as warmer summer and winter temperatures
      and changes in precipitation.[27][28][29][30] For example, one study found upslope
      retractions in 44 of 64 watersheds surveyed in the Northern Rockies, with retractions
      averaging 281\_m (922\_ft).[31] Although a pika can meet its water demand from
      the vegetation eaten, it does drink water if it is available in its environment.[14]\\\\nPikas
      have two different ways of foraging; they directly consume food (feeding) or
      they cache food in haypiles to use for a food source in the winter (haying).[11]
      They feed throughout the year while haying is limited to the summer.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\":
      \\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pika\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Pikas do not
      hibernate and remain active throughout the winter by traveling in tunnels under
      rocks and snow and eating dried plants that they have stored.[14] Rock-dwelling
      pikas exhibit two methods of foraging: the first involves direct consumption
      of food, and the second is characterized by the gathering of plants to store
      in a \\\\\\\"haypile\\\\\\\" of cached plants.[15]\\\\nThe impact of human activity
      on the tundra ecosystems where pikas live has been recorded dating back to the
      1970s.[16] Rather than hibernate during winter, pikas forage for grasses and
      other forms of plant matter and stash these findings in protected dens in a
      process called \\\\\\\"haying\\\\\\\".\\\\n Such interactions with humans have
      been linked to pikas having reduced amounts of foraging time, consequentially
      limiting the amount of food they can stockpile for winter months.[18] Pikas
      prefer foraging in temperatures below 25\_\xB0C (77\_\xB0F), so they generally
      spend their time in shaded regions and out of direct sunlight when temperatures
      are high.[18] A link has also been found between temperature increases and lost
      foraging time, where for every increase of 1\_\xB0C (1.8\_\xB0F) to the ambient
      temperature in alpine landscapes home to pikas, those pikas lose 3% of their
      foraging time.[18]\\\\nEurasian pikas commonly live in family groups and share
      duties of gathering food and keeping watch. Pleistocene fossils of the extant
      steppe pika O. pusilla currently native to Asia have been found also in many
      countries of Europe from the United Kingdom to Russia and from Italy to Poland,
      and the Asiatic extant northern pika O. hyperborea in one location in the middle
      Pleistocene United States.[1]\\\\nWhile Ochotona is the only currently living
      genus of Ochotonidae, extinct genera of ochotonids include\\\\n\u2020Albertona,

      stem-lagomorphs.[36]\\\\nOchotonids appeared in Asia between the late Eocene

      of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada
      to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
      Nevada, California, and New Mexico.[10] Of the 30 existing species of pika,
      it is one of only two which inhabit North America, along with the collared pika
      (O. collaris). The project concluded in 2016.[26]\\\\nMore recent studies have
      found widespread extirpations and range retractions at lower elevations which
      are typically warmer and drier, patterns that have been further attributed to
      varying aspects of climate change such as warmer summer and winter temperatures
      and changes in precipitation.[27][28][29][30] For example, one study found upslope
      retractions in 44 of 64 watersheds surveyed in the Northern Rockies, with retractions
      averaging 281\_m (922\_ft).[31] Although a pika can meet its water demand from
      the vegetation eaten, it does drink water if it is available in its environment.[14]\\\\nPikas

      I\\\\nCharacteristics of sites in the hydrological Great Basin, western United
      States, used in relevant analyses, 1994\u20132008, as presented by Beever et
      al. (2011:Appendix V), with calculations of range retraction. In this review
      I 1) review the paleontological history of the American pika in North America;
      2) outline why pikas are an exceptional species to study with regard to environmental
      change; 3) summarize relevant information on the status of pikas across the
      species\u2019 range; 4) highlight aspects of the resiliency of pikas living
      in extreme environments; 5) review how relevant traits of pikas may be impacted
      by environmental change; and 6) present the current conservation status of the
      pika. The mechanistic climatic models of Mathewson et al. (2017) correctly predicted
      the prehistoric retrenchment of pikas in the Great Basin, as well as the current
      distribution of pikas, but failed to account for the presence of pikas at Craters
      of the Moon, Lava Beds National Monument, Newberry National Volcanic Monument,
      or along the Columbia River Gorge (and presumably also at Bodie and the Mono
      Craters; collectively \u201Coutlier sites\u201D). Meanwhile, the pattern of
      occupancy in the northern constellation of patches, while variable from year
      to year, was unchanged; in fact, the documented number of pikas in the north
      in our 2009 and 2010 surveys exceeded the number of pikas counted in the north
      in 1972 or 1977 (Smith and Nagy 2015). Characteristics of Pikas in Stressful
      Environments\\\\nOur understanding of the current distribution and local abundance
      of American pika populations is contingent on a thorough understanding of the
      natural history of the species, notably missing from most of the contemporary
      work on pikas involving regional surveys.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9475130/\\\",
      \\\"content\\\": \\\"Our observations in 2021 of pikas on the Noonday Mine,
      coupled with those of pika occupancy on the Red Cloud Mine and the Booker Consolidated
      shaft (Klingler,\_2017; Nichols et al.,\_2016), indicate that following nearly
      a decade of extirpated status, there have been multiple re\u2010colonization
      episodes from the northern constellation to the southern constellation.\\\\n2.2.
      Nichols et al.\_(2016, p. 167\u2013168) mention seeing a pika in 2015 at an
      undisclosed site 1.2\_km from \u201Cthe nearest occupied patch\u201D \u2013
      most likely the Red Cloud Mine, 400\u2009m from the Noonday Mine (thus, the
      contention earlier in Nichols et al.,\_2016 that the southern constellation
      was extirpated at that time was incorrect). Although we know of only one other
      occupied site at the south end of the Craters, the potential exists for other
      active pika sites near NMCR that could have been the source for the re\u2010colonization
      observed in 2021 \u2013 such as the apparently transient individual observed
      via our camera trap in 2018 (Millar & Hickman,\_2021). At the far north end
      of the Mono Craters, 7\_km from the Pumice Mine site, Millar (Millar & Hickman,\_2021;
      Millar et al.,\_2013; C. I. Millar, unpublished observations) has been monitoring

      Figures\_1c and \u200Band2c).2c). C. I. Millar (unpublished surveys) has extensively
      explored talus habitat throughout the Mono Craters since 2009 using widely accepted
      methods for evaluating occupancy as follows: current occupancy of a talus (pika
      seen or heard and/or presence of current\u2010year haypile vegetation), former
      occupancy (only old haypile vegetation or dried, decomposing fecal pellets),
      or no indication of occupancy (none of these signs; Beever et al.,\_2003; Jeffress

      of sites in the hydrological Great Basin, western United States, used in relevant
      analyses, 1994\u20132008, as presented by Beever et al. (2011:Appendix V), with
      calculations of range retraction. In this review I 1) review the paleontological
      history of the American pika in North America; 2) outline why pikas are an exceptional
      species to study with regard to environmental change; 3) summarize relevant
      information on the status of pikas across the species\u2019 range; 4) highlight
      aspects of the resiliency of pikas living in extreme environments; 5) review
      how relevant traits of pikas may be impacted by environmental change; and 6)
      present the current conservation status of the pika. The mechanistic climatic
      models of Mathewson et al. (2017) correctly predicted the prehistoric retrenchment
      of pikas in the Great Basin, as well as the current distribution of pikas, but
      failed to account for the presence of pikas at Craters of the Moon, Lava Beds
      National Monument, Newberry National Volcanic Monument, or along the Columbia
      River Gorge (and presumably also at Bodie and the Mono Craters; collectively
      \u201Coutlier sites\u201D). Meanwhile, the pattern of occupancy in the northern
      constellation of patches, while variable from year to year, was unchanged; in
      fact, the documented number of pikas in the north in our 2009 and 2010 surveys
      exceeded the number of pikas counted in the north in 1972 or 1977 (Smith and
      Nagy 2015). Characteristics of Pikas in Stressful Environments\\nOur understanding
      of the current distribution and local abundance of American pika populations
      is contingent on a thorough understanding of the natural history of the species,
      notably missing from most of the contemporary work on pikas involving regional
      surveys.\",\"score\":0.9558167,\"raw_content\":null},{\"title\":\"Return of

      status, there have been multiple re\u2010colonization episodes from the northern
      constellation to the southern constellation.\\n2.2. Nichols et al.\_(2016, p.

      Although we know of only one other occupied site at the south end of the Craters,
      the potential exists for other active pika sites near NMCR that could have been
      the source for the re\u2010colonization observed in 2021 \u2013 such as the

      (90 and 100\u00a0\u00b0F), respectively.[22]\\nRecent studies suggest some populations
      are declining due to various factors, most notably global warming.[20] A 2003
      study, published in the Journal of Mammalogy, showed nine of 25 sampled populations
      of American pika had been extirpated in the Great Basin, leading biologists
      to conduct further investigations to determine if the species as a whole is
      vulnerable.[23]\\nIn 2010, the US government considered, then decided not to
      add the American pika under the US Endangered Species Act.[24] The original
      scientific name was Lepus (Lagomys) princeps.[18]\\nConservation and decline[edit]\\nAs
      they live in the high and cooler mountain regions, they are very sensitive to
      high temperatures, and are considered to be one of the best early warning systems
      for detecting global warming in the western United States.[19]\\nTemperature
      increases are suspected to be one cause of American pikas moving higher in elevation[20]
      in an attempt to find suitable habitat, as well as cooler temperatures. Distribution
      and habitat[edit]\\nThe American pika can be found throughout the mountains
      of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada
      to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
      Nevada, California, and New Mexico.[10] Of the 30 existing species of pika,
      it is one of only two which inhabit North America, along with the collared pika
      (O. collaris). The project concluded in 2016.[26]\\nMore recent studies have
      found widespread extirpations and range retractions at lower elevations which
      are typically warmer and drier, patterns that have been further attributed to
      varying aspects of climate change such as warmer summer and winter temperatures
      and changes in precipitation.[27][28][29][30] For example, one study found upslope
      retractions in 44 of 64 watersheds surveyed in the Northern Rockies, with retractions
      averaging 281\u00a0m (922\u00a0ft).[31] Although a pika can meet its water demand
      from the vegetation eaten, it does drink water if it is available in its environment.[14]\\nPikas
      have two different ways of foraging; they directly consume food (feeding) or
      they cache food in haypiles to use for a food source in the winter (haying).[11]
      They feed throughout the year while haying is limited to the summer.\"}, {\"url\":
      \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pika\", \"content\": \"Pikas do not hibernate
      and remain active throughout the winter by traveling in tunnels under rocks
      and snow and eating dried plants that they have stored.[14] Rock-dwelling pikas
      exhibit two methods of foraging: the first involves direct consumption of food,
      and the second is characterized by the gathering of plants to store in a \\\"haypile\\\"
      of cached plants.[15]\\nThe impact of human activity on the tundra ecosystems
      where pikas live has been recorded dating back to the 1970s.[16] Rather than
      hibernate during winter, pikas forage for grasses and other forms of plant matter
      and stash these findings in protected dens in a process called \\\"haying\\\".\\n
      Such interactions with humans have been linked to pikas having reduced amounts
      of foraging time, consequentially limiting the amount of food they can stockpile
      for winter months.[18] Pikas prefer foraging in temperatures below 25\u00a0\u00b0C
      (77\u00a0\u00b0F), so they generally spend their time in shaded regions and
      out of direct sunlight when temperatures are high.[18] A link has also been
      found between temperature increases and lost foraging time, where for every
      increase of 1\u00a0\u00b0C (1.8\u00a0\u00b0F) to the ambient temperature in
      alpine landscapes home to pikas, those pikas lose 3% of their foraging time.[18]\\nEurasian
      pikas commonly live in family groups and share duties of gathering food and
      keeping watch. Pleistocene fossils of the extant steppe pika O. pusilla currently
      native to Asia have been found also in many countries of Europe from the United
      Kingdom to Russia and from Italy to Poland, and the Asiatic extant northern
      pika O. hyperborea in one location in the middle Pleistocene United States.[1]\\nWhile
      Ochotona is the only currently living genus of Ochotonidae, extinct genera of
      ochotonids include\\n\u2020Albertona, \u2020Alloptox, \u2020Amphilagus, \u2020Australagomys,

      is Desmatolagus (middle Eocene to Miocene, 42.5\u201314.8 Ma[1]), usually included
      in the Ochotonidae, sometimes in Leporidae or in neither ochotonid nor leporid
      stem-lagomorphs.[36]\\nOchotonids appeared in Asia between the late Eocene and
      the early Oligocene, and continued to develop along with increased distribution
      of C3 grasses in previously forest dominated areas under the \\\"climatic optimum\\\"
      from the late Oligocene to middle Miocene. The North American collared pika
      (O. collaris) and American pika (O. princeps) have been suggested to have descended
      from the same ancestor as the steppe pika (O. pusilla).[25]\\nThe range of Ochotona
      was larger in the past, with both extinct and extant species inhabiting Western
      Europe and Eastern North America, areas that are currently free of pikas.\"},

      only a few hours of exposure to temperatures like 78 degrees F.\\nPopulation
      number\\nThe IUCN Red List and other sources don\u2019t provide the number of
      the American pika total population size. Biome\\nClimate zones\\nHabits and
      Lifestyle\\nAmerican pikas are adapted to very inhospitable environments, living
      where most other mammals avoid going - the treeless slopes of mountains: a very
      rocky, cold, and treacherous habitat for the tiny pika. Population\\nPopulation
      threats\\nThe major threat to American pikas is global climate change, and this
      species is in line to become the first North American mammal to be a victim
      of this threat. Ecological niche\\nDue to collecting and storing of food in
      piles in crevices or on rocks, American pikas modify their habitat and thus
      have earned the label of \u2018ecosystem engineer\u2019.\\n\"}, {\"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_pika\",

      these sites are 32 and 38\u00a0\u00b0C (90 and 100\u00a0\u00b0F), respectively.[22]\\nRecent
      studies suggest some populations are declining due to various factors, most
      notably global warming.[20] A 2003 study, published in the Journal of Mammalogy,
      showed nine of 25 sampled populations of American pika had been extirpated in
      the Great Basin, leading biologists to conduct further investigations to determine
      if the species as a whole is vulnerable.[23]\\nIn 2010, the US government considered,
      then decided not to add the American pika under the US Endangered Species Act.[24]
      The original scientific name was Lepus (Lagomys) princeps.[18]\\nConservation
      and decline[edit]\\nAs they live in the high and cooler mountain regions, they
      are very sensitive to high temperatures, and are considered to be one of the
      best early warning systems for detecting global warming in the western United
      States.[19]\\nTemperature increases are suspected to be one cause of American
      pikas moving higher in elevation[20] in an attempt to find suitable habitat,
      as well as cooler temperatures. Distribution and habitat[edit]\\nThe American
      pika can be found throughout the mountains of western North America, from central
      British Columbia and Alberta in Canada to the US states of Oregon, Washington,
      Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, and New Mexico.[10]
      Of the 30 existing species of pika, it is one of only two which inhabit North
      America, along with the collared pika (O. collaris). The project concluded in
      2016.[26]\\nMore recent studies have found widespread extirpations and range
      retractions at lower elevations which are typically warmer and drier, patterns
      that have been further attributed to varying aspects of climate change such
      as warmer summer and winter temperatures and changes in precipitation.[27][28][29][30]
      For example, one study found upslope retractions in 44 of 64 watersheds surveyed
      in the Northern Rockies, with retractions averaging 281\u00a0m (922\u00a0ft).[31]
      Although a pika can meet its water demand from the vegetation eaten, it does
      drink water if it is available in its environment.[14]\\nPikas have two different
      ways of foraging; they directly consume food (feeding) or they cache food in
      haypiles to use for a food source in the winter (haying).[11] They feed throughout
      the year while haying is limited to the summer.\"}]", "role": "tool", "tool_call_id":

      of sites in the hydrological Great Basin, western United States, used in relevant
      analyses, 1994\u20132008, as presented by Beever et al. (2011:Appendix V), with
      calculations of range retraction. In this review I 1) review the paleontological
      history of the American pika in North America; 2) outline why pikas are an exceptional
      species to study with regard to environmental change; 3) summarize relevant
      information on the status of pikas across the species\u2019 range; 4) highlight
      aspects of the resiliency of pikas living in extreme environments; 5) review
      how relevant traits of pikas may be impacted by environmental change; and 6)
      present the current conservation status of the pika. The mechanistic climatic
      models of Mathewson et al. (2017) correctly predicted the prehistoric retrenchment
      of pikas in the Great Basin, as well as the current distribution of pikas, but
      failed to account for the presence of pikas at Craters of the Moon, Lava Beds
      National Monument, Newberry National Volcanic Monument, or along the Columbia
      River Gorge (and presumably also at Bodie and the Mono Craters; collectively
      \u201coutlier sites\u201d). Meanwhile, the pattern of occupancy in the northern
      constellation of patches, while variable from year to year, was unchanged; in
      fact, the documented number of pikas in the north in our 2009 and 2010 surveys
      exceeded the number of pikas counted in the north in 1972 or 1977 (Smith and
      Nagy 2015). Characteristics of Pikas in Stressful Environments\\nOur understanding
      of the current distribution and local abundance of American pika populations
      is contingent on a thorough understanding of the natural history of the species,
      notably missing from most of the contemporary work on pikas involving regional
      surveys.\"}, {\"url\": \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9475130/\",

      nearly a decade of extirpated status, there have been multiple re\u2010colonization
      episodes from the northern constellation to the southern constellation.\\n2.2.
      Nichols et al.\u00a0(2016, p. 167\u2013168) mention seeing a pika in 2015 at
      an undisclosed site 1.2\u00a0km from \u201cthe nearest occupied patch\u201d
      \u2013 most likely the Red Cloud Mine, 400\u2009m from the Noonday Mine (thus,
      the contention earlier in Nichols et al.,\u00a02016 that the southern constellation
      was extirpated at that time was incorrect). Although we know of only one other
      occupied site at the south end of the Craters, the potential exists for other
      active pika sites near NMCR that could have been the source for the re\u2010colonization
      observed in 2021 \u2013 such as the apparently transient individual observed
      via our camera trap in 2018 (Millar & Hickman,\u00a02021). At the far north

      as follows: current occupancy of a talus (pika seen or heard and/or presence
      of current\u2010year haypile vegetation), former occupancy (only old haypile

      Research Report on Pikas\\n\\n#### Introduction\\nPikas are small, herbivorous
      mammals belonging to the family Ochotonidae within the order Lagomorpha, which
      also includes rabbits and hares. There are 30 recognized species of pikas, with
      the American pika (Ochotona princeps) and the collared pika (Ochotona collaris)
      being the two species found in North America. This report provides a comprehensive
      overview of pikas focusing on their habitat, diet, behavior, social structure,
      and conservation status.\\n\\n#### Habitat and Distribution\\nPikas inhabit
      cold climates, predominantly found in alpine and subalpine regions. Their distribution
      spans across the mountainous areas of western North America, from central British
      Columbia and Alberta in Canada to various states in the USA, including Oregon,
      Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, and
      New Mexico.\\n\\nPikas thrive in rocky terrains, such as talus slopes and meadows
      rich in vegetation, which provide both shelter and food. These environments
      are typically characterized by cooler temperatures, which are crucial for the
      survival of pikas. They are highly sensitive to temperature increases and are
      often used as indicators for the effects of climate change.\\n\\n#### Diet and
      Feeding Habits\\nPikas are generalist herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses,
      forbs, and small shrubs. They exhibit two primary foraging behaviors: direct
      consumption and caching of plants. The latter involves gathering and storing
      vegetation in \\\"haypiles\\\" to sustain them through the winter months when
      food is scarce.\\n\\nTheir diet is diverse, extending to various alpine meadow
      plants. During the summer, pikas actively collect and dry plant material, which
      they store in their dens or crevices between rocks. This \\\"haying\\\" behavior
      is critical for their winter survival, as they do not hibernate and rely on
      these stored food reserves.\\n\\n#### Behavior and Social Structure\\nPikas
      are diurnal and exhibit a range of social behaviors. While some species are
      solitary, others, like the Eurasian pikas, live in family groups and share responsibilities
      such as gathering food and keeping watch for predators. The social structure
      of pikas can influence their foraging behavior and territory establishment.\\n\\nPlateau
      pikas, for instance, show significant variation in their social complexity,
      with family groups demonstrating different social systems. Interactions within
      these groups can include cooperative behaviors as well as aggressive encounters,
      particularly among males from different families.\\n\\n#### Conservation Status\\nThe
      conservation status of pikas varies among species. The American pika, in particular,
      faces threats from global climate change. They are highly susceptible to temperature
      increases, which can lead to habitat loss as they are forced to move to higher
      elevations in search of suitable conditions. Studies have documented declines
      in pika populations in regions like the Great Basin, where warmer and drier
      conditions prevail.\\n\\nDespite these challenges, the US government decided
      in 2010 not to list the American pika under the Endangered Species Act. However,
      pikas remain a focal species for climate change research due to their sensitivity
      to environmental changes.\\n\\nEfforts to monitor and conserve pika populations
      include long-term studies and citizen science programs, which aim to track their
      distribution, behavior, and population trends. These initiatives are crucial
      for understanding the impacts of climate change and implementing effective conservation
      strategies.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\nPikas are fascinating small mammals with
      unique adaptations to cold alpine environments. Their behaviors, particularly
      their haying and social interactions, are integral to their survival. However,
      they face significant threats from climate change, which necessitates ongoing
      research and conservation efforts to ensure their persistence in a rapidly changing

      and extreme maximum surface temperatures in August at these sites are 32 and
      38\_\xB0C (90 and 100\_\xB0F), respectively.[22]\\\\nRecent studies suggest
      some populations are declining due to various factors, most notably global warming.[20]
      A 2003 study, published in the Journal of Mammalogy, showed nine of 25 sampled
      populations of American pika had been extirpated in the Great Basin, leading
      biologists to conduct further investigations to determine if the species as
      a whole is vulnerable.[23]\\\\nIn 2010, the US government considered, then decided
      not to add the American pika under the US Endangered Species Act.[24] The original
      scientific name was Lepus (Lagomys) princeps.[18]\\\\nConservation and decline[edit]\\\\nAs
      they live in the high and cooler mountain regions, they are very sensitive to
      high temperatures, and are considered to be one of the best early warning systems
      for detecting global warming in the western United States.[19]\\\\nTemperature
      increases are suspected to be one cause of American pikas moving higher in elevation[20]
      in an attempt to find suitable habitat, as well as cooler temperatures. Distribution
      and habitat[edit]\\\\nThe American pika can be found throughout the mountains
      of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada
      to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
      Nevada, California, and New Mexico.[10] Of the 30 existing species of pika,
      it is one of only two which inhabit North America, along with the collared pika
      (O. collaris). The project concluded in 2016.[26]\\\\nMore recent studies have
      found widespread extirpations and range retractions at lower elevations which
      are typically warmer and drier, patterns that have been further attributed to
      varying aspects of climate change such as warmer summer and winter temperatures
      and changes in precipitation.[27][28][29][30] For example, one study found upslope
      retractions in 44 of 64 watersheds surveyed in the Northern Rockies, with retractions
      averaging 281\_m (922\_ft).[31] Although a pika can meet its water demand from
      the vegetation eaten, it does drink water if it is available in its environment.[14]\\\\nPikas
      have two different ways of foraging; they directly consume food (feeding) or
      they cache food in haypiles to use for a food source in the winter (haying).[11]
      They feed throughout the year while haying is limited to the summer.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\":
      \\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pika\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Pikas do not
      hibernate and remain active throughout the winter by traveling in tunnels under
      rocks and snow and eating dried plants that they have stored.[14] Rock-dwelling
      pikas exhibit two methods of foraging: the first involves direct consumption
      of food, and the second is characterized by the gathering of plants to store
      in a \\\\\\\"haypile\\\\\\\" of cached plants.[15]\\\\nThe impact of human activity
      on the tundra ecosystems where pikas live has been recorded dating back to the
      1970s.[16] Rather than hibernate during winter, pikas forage for grasses and
      other forms of plant matter and stash these findings in protected dens in a
      process called \\\\\\\"haying\\\\\\\".\\\\n Such interactions with humans have
      been linked to pikas having reduced amounts of foraging time, consequentially
      limiting the amount of food they can stockpile for winter months.[18] Pikas
      prefer foraging in temperatures below 25\_\xB0C (77\_\xB0F), so they generally
      spend their time in shaded regions and out of direct sunlight when temperatures
      are high.[18] A link has also been found between temperature increases and lost
      foraging time, where for every increase of 1\_\xB0C (1.8\_\xB0F) to the ambient
      temperature in alpine landscapes home to pikas, those pikas lose 3% of their
      foraging time.[18]\\\\nEurasian pikas commonly live in family groups and share
      duties of gathering food and keeping watch. Pleistocene fossils of the extant
      steppe pika O. pusilla currently native to Asia have been found also in many
      countries of Europe from the United Kingdom to Russia and from Italy to Poland,
      and the Asiatic extant northern pika O. hyperborea in one location in the middle
      Pleistocene United States.[1]\\\\nWhile Ochotona is the only currently living
      genus of Ochotonidae, extinct genera of ochotonids include\\\\n\u2020Albertona,

      populations are declining due to various factors, most notably global warming.[20]
      A 2003 study, published in the Journal of Mammalogy, showed nine of 25 sampled
      populations of American pika had been extirpated in the Great Basin, leading
      biologists to conduct further investigations to determine if the species as
      a whole is vulnerable.[23]\\nIn 2010, the US government considered, then decided
      not to add the American pika under the US Endangered Species Act.[24] The original
      scientific name was Lepus (Lagomys) princeps.[18]\\nConservation and decline[edit]\\nAs
      they live in the high and cooler mountain regions, they are very sensitive to
      high temperatures, and are considered to be one of the best early warning systems
      for detecting global warming in the western United States.[19]\\nTemperature
      increases are suspected to be one cause of American pikas moving higher in elevation[20]
      in an attempt to find suitable habitat, as well as cooler temperatures. Distribution
      and habitat[edit]\\nThe American pika can be found throughout the mountains
      of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada
      to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
      Nevada, California, and New Mexico.[10] Of the 30 existing species of pika,
      it is one of only two which inhabit North America, along with the collared pika
      (O. collaris). The project concluded in 2016.[26]\\nMore recent studies have
      found widespread extirpations and range retractions at lower elevations which
      are typically warmer and drier, patterns that have been further attributed to
      varying aspects of climate change such as warmer summer and winter temperatures
      and changes in precipitation.[27][28][29][30] For example, one study found upslope
      retractions in 44 of 64 watersheds surveyed in the Northern Rockies, with retractions
      averaging 281\_m (922\_ft).[31] Although a pika can meet its water demand from
      the vegetation eaten, it does drink water if it is available in its environment.[14]\\nPikas
      have two different ways of foraging; they directly consume food (feeding) or
      they cache food in haypiles to use for a food source in the winter (haying).[11]
      They feed throughout the year while haying is limited to the summer.\",\"score\":0.9972316,\"raw_content\":null},{\"title\":\"Pika
      - Wikipedia\",\"url\":\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pika\",\"content\":\"Pikas
      do not hibernate and remain active throughout the winter by traveling in tunnels
      under rocks and snow and eating dried plants that they have stored.[14] Rock-dwelling
      pikas exhibit two methods of foraging: the first involves direct consumption
      of food, and the second is characterized by the gathering of plants to store
      in a \\\"haypile\\\" of cached plants.[15]\\nThe impact of human activity on
      the tundra ecosystems where pikas live has been recorded dating back to the
      1970s.[16] Rather than hibernate during winter, pikas forage for grasses and
      other forms of plant matter and stash these findings in protected dens in a
      process called \\\"haying\\\".\\n Such interactions with humans have been linked
      to pikas having reduced amounts of foraging time, consequentially limiting the
      amount of food they can stockpile for winter months.[18] Pikas prefer foraging
      in temperatures below 25\_\xB0C (77\_\xB0F), so they generally spend their time
      in shaded regions and out of direct sunlight when temperatures are high.[18]
      A link has also been found between temperature increases and lost foraging time,
      where for every increase of 1\_\xB0C (1.8\_\xB0F) to the ambient temperature
      in alpine landscapes home to pikas, those pikas lose 3% of their foraging time.[18]\\nEurasian
      pikas commonly live in family groups and share duties of gathering food and
      keeping watch. Pleistocene fossils of the extant steppe pika O. pusilla currently
      native to Asia have been found also in many countries of Europe from the United
      Kingdom to Russia and from Italy to Poland, and the Asiatic extant northern
      pika O. hyperborea in one location in the middle Pleistocene United States.[1]\\nWhile

      it is one of only two which inhabit North America, along with the collared pika
      (O. collaris). The project concluded in 2016.[26]\\nMore recent studies have
      found widespread extirpations and range retractions at lower elevations which
      are typically warmer and drier, patterns that have been further attributed to
      varying aspects of climate change such as warmer summer and winter temperatures
      and changes in precipitation.[27][28][29][30] For example, one study found upslope
      retractions in 44 of 64 watersheds surveyed in the Northern Rockies, with retractions
      averaging 281\_m (922\_ft).[31] Although a pika can meet its water demand from
      the vegetation eaten, it does drink water if it is available in its environment.[14]\\nPikas
      have two different ways of foraging; they directly consume food (feeding) or
      they cache food in haypiles to use for a food source in the winter (haying).[11]
      They feed throughout the year while haying is limited to the summer.\",\"score\":0.7112304,\"raw_content\":null}],\"response_time\":1.9},\"status\":\"success\"},{\"content\":\"[{\\\"url\\\":

      I\\\\nCharacteristics of sites in the hydrological Great Basin, western United
      States, used in relevant analyses, 1994\u20132008, as presented by Beever et
      al. (2011:Appendix V), with calculations of range retraction. In this review
      I 1) review the paleontological history of the American pika in North America;
      2) outline why pikas are an exceptional species to study with regard to environmental
      change; 3) summarize relevant information on the status of pikas across the
      species\u2019 range; 4) highlight aspects of the resiliency of pikas living
      in extreme environments; 5) review how relevant traits of pikas may be impacted
      by environmental change; and 6) present the current conservation status of the
      pika. The mechanistic climatic models of Mathewson et al. (2017) correctly predicted
      the prehistoric retrenchment of pikas in the Great Basin, as well as the current
      distribution of pikas, but failed to account for the presence of pikas at Craters
      of the Moon, Lava Beds National Monument, Newberry National Volcanic Monument,
      or along the Columbia River Gorge (and presumably also at Bodie and the Mono
      Craters; collectively \u201Coutlier sites\u201D). Meanwhile, the pattern of
      occupancy in the northern constellation of patches, while variable from year
      to year, was unchanged; in fact, the documented number of pikas in the north
      in our 2009 and 2010 surveys exceeded the number of pikas counted in the north
      in 1972 or 1977 (Smith and Nagy 2015). Characteristics of Pikas in Stressful
      Environments\\\\nOur understanding of the current distribution and local abundance
      of American pika populations is contingent on a thorough understanding of the
      natural history of the species, notably missing from most of the contemporary
      work on pikas involving regional surveys.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9475130/\\\",
      \\\"content\\\": \\\"Our observations in 2021 of pikas on the Noonday Mine,
      coupled with those of pika occupancy on the Red Cloud Mine and the Booker Consolidated
      shaft (Klingler,\_2017; Nichols et al.,\_2016), indicate that following nearly
      a decade of extirpated status, there have been multiple re\u2010colonization
      episodes from the northern constellation to the southern constellation.\\\\n2.2.
      Nichols et al.\_(2016, p. 167\u2013168) mention seeing a pika in 2015 at an
      undisclosed site 1.2\_km from \u201Cthe nearest occupied patch\u201D \u2013
      most likely the Red Cloud Mine, 400\u2009m from the Noonday Mine (thus, the
      contention earlier in Nichols et al.,\_2016 that the southern constellation
      was extirpated at that time was incorrect). Although we know of only one other
      occupied site at the south end of the Craters, the potential exists for other
      active pika sites near NMCR that could have been the source for the re\u2010colonization
      observed in 2021 \u2013 such as the apparently transient individual observed
      via our camera trap in 2018 (Millar & Hickman,\_2021). At the far north end
      of the Mono Craters, 7\_km from the Pumice Mine site, Millar (Millar & Hickman,\_2021;
      Millar et al.,\_2013; C. I. Millar, unpublished observations) has been monitoring
      the presence of pika sites since 2011 (North Mono Craters, NMCR; 2092\u20132260\u2009m;
      Figures\_1c and \u200Band2c).2c). C. I. Millar (unpublished surveys) has extensively
      explored talus habitat throughout the Mono Craters since 2009 using widely accepted
      methods for evaluating occupancy as follows: current occupancy of a talus (pika
      seen or heard and/or presence of current\u2010year haypile vegetation), former
      occupancy (only old haypile vegetation or dried, decomposing fecal pellets),
      or no indication of occupancy (none of these signs; Beever et al.,\_2003; Jeffress

      167\u2013168) mention seeing a pika in 2015 at an undisclosed site 1.2\_km from
      \u201Cthe nearest occupied patch\u201D \u2013 most likely the Red Cloud Mine,
      400\u2009m from the Noonday Mine (thus, the contention earlier in Nichols et
      al.,\_2016 that the southern constellation was extirpated at that time was incorrect).
      Although we know of only one other occupied site at the south end of the Craters,
      the potential exists for other active pika sites near NMCR that could have been
      the source for the re\u2010colonization observed in 2021 \u2013 such as the
      apparently transient individual observed via our camera trap in 2018 (Millar
      & Hickman,\_2021). At the far north end of the Mono Craters, 7\_km from the
      Pumice Mine site, Millar (Millar & Hickman,\_2021; Millar et al.,\_2013; C.
      I. Millar, unpublished observations) has been monitoring the presence of pika
      sites since 2011 (North Mono Craters, NMCR; 2092\u20132260\u2009m; Figures\_1c
      and \u200Band2c).2c). C. I. Millar (unpublished surveys) has extensively explored
      talus habitat throughout the Mono Craters since 2009 using widely accepted methods
      for evaluating occupancy as follows: current occupancy of a talus (pika seen
      or heard and/or presence of current\u2010year haypile vegetation), former occupancy
      (only old haypile vegetation or dried, decomposing fecal pellets), or no indication
      of occupancy (none of these signs; Beever et al.,\_2003; Jeffress et al.,\_2017;

      Research Report on Pikas\\n\\n#### Introduction\\nPikas are small, herbivorous
      mammals belonging to the family Ochotonidae within the order Lagomorpha, which
      also includes rabbits and hares. There are 30 recognized species of pikas, with
      the American pika (Ochotona princeps) and the collared pika (Ochotona collaris)
      being the two species found in North America. This report provides a comprehensive
      overview of pikas focusing on their habitat, diet, behavior, social structure,
      and conservation status.\\n\\n#### Habitat and Distribution\\nPikas inhabit
      cold climates, predominantly found in alpine and subalpine regions. Their distribution
      spans across the mountainous areas of western North America, from central British
      Columbia and Alberta in Canada to various states in the USA, including Oregon,
      Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, and
      New Mexico.\\n\\nPikas thrive in rocky terrains, such as talus slopes and meadows
      rich in vegetation, which provide both shelter and food. These environments
      are typically characterized by cooler temperatures, which are crucial for the
      survival of pikas. They are highly sensitive to temperature increases and are
      often used as indicators for the effects of climate change.\\n\\n#### Diet and
      Feeding Habits\\nPikas are generalist herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses,
      forbs, and small shrubs. They exhibit two primary foraging behaviors: direct
      consumption and caching of plants. The latter involves gathering and storing
      vegetation in \\\"haypiles\\\" to sustain them through the winter months when
      food is scarce.\\n\\nTheir diet is diverse, extending to various alpine meadow
      plants. During the summer, pikas actively collect and dry plant material, which
      they store in their dens or crevices between rocks. This \\\"haying\\\" behavior
      is critical for their winter survival, as they do not hibernate and rely on
      these stored food reserves.\\n\\n#### Behavior and Social Structure\\nPikas
      are diurnal and exhibit a range of social behaviors. While some species are
      solitary, others, like the Eurasian pikas, live in family groups and share responsibilities
      such as gathering food and keeping watch for predators. The social structure
      of pikas can influence their foraging behavior and territory establishment.\\n\\nPlateau
      pikas, for instance, show significant variation in their social complexity,
      with family groups demonstrating different social systems. Interactions within
      these groups can include cooperative behaviors as well as aggressive encounters,
      particularly among males from different families.\\n\\n#### Conservation Status\\nThe
      conservation status of pikas varies among species. The American pika, in particular,
      faces threats from global climate change. They are highly susceptible to temperature
      increases, which can lead to habitat loss as they are forced to move to higher
      elevations in search of suitable conditions. Studies have documented declines
      in pika populations in regions like the Great Basin, where warmer and drier
      conditions prevail.\\n\\nDespite these challenges, the US government decided
      in 2010 not to list the American pika under the Endangered Species Act. However,
      pikas remain a focal species for climate change research due to their sensitivity
      to environmental changes.\\n\\nEfforts to monitor and conserve pika populations
      include long-term studies and citizen science programs, which aim to track their
      distribution, behavior, and population trends. These initiatives are crucial
      for understanding the impacts of climate change and implementing effective conservation
      strategies.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\nPikas are fascinating small mammals with
      unique adaptations to cold alpine environments. Their behaviors, particularly
      their haying and social interactions, are integral to their survival. However,
      they face significant threats from climate change, which necessitates ongoing
      research and conservation efforts to ensure their persistence in a rapidly changing

      Research Report on Pikas\\n\\n#### Introduction\\nPikas are small, herbivorous
      mammals belonging to the family Ochotonidae within the order Lagomorpha, which
      also includes rabbits and hares. There are 30 recognized species of pikas, with
      the American pika (Ochotona princeps) and the collared pika (Ochotona collaris)
      being the two species found in North America. This report provides a comprehensive
      overview of pikas focusing on their habitat, diet, behavior, social structure,
      and conservation status.\\n\\n#### Habitat and Distribution\\nPikas inhabit
      cold climates, predominantly found in alpine and subalpine regions. Their distribution
      spans across the mountainous areas of western North America, from central British
      Columbia and Alberta in Canada to various states in the USA, including Oregon,
      Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, and
      New Mexico.\\n\\nPikas thrive in rocky terrains, such as talus slopes and meadows
      rich in vegetation, which provide both shelter and food. These environments
      are typically characterized by cooler temperatures, which are crucial for the
      survival of pikas. They are highly sensitive to temperature increases and are
      often used as indicators for the effects of climate change.\\n\\n#### Diet and
      Feeding Habits\\nPikas are generalist herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses,
      forbs, and small shrubs. They exhibit two primary foraging behaviors: direct
      consumption and caching of plants. The latter involves gathering and storing
      vegetation in \\\"haypiles\\\" to sustain them through the winter months when
      food is scarce.\\n\\nTheir diet is diverse, extending to various alpine meadow
      plants. During the summer, pikas actively collect and dry plant material, which
      they store in their dens or crevices between rocks. This \\\"haying\\\" behavior
      is critical for their winter survival, as they do not hibernate and rely on
      these stored food reserves.\\n\\n#### Behavior and Social Structure\\nPikas
      are diurnal and exhibit a range of social behaviors. While some species are
      solitary, others, like the Eurasian pikas, live in family groups and share responsibilities
      such as gathering food and keeping watch for predators. The social structure
      of pikas can influence their foraging behavior and territory establishment.\\n\\nPlateau
      pikas, for instance, show significant variation in their social complexity,
      with family groups demonstrating different social systems. Interactions within
      these groups can include cooperative behaviors as well as aggressive encounters,
      particularly among males from different families.\\n\\n#### Conservation Status\\nThe
      conservation status of pikas varies among species. The American pika, in particular,
      faces threats from global climate change. They are highly susceptible to temperature
      increases, which can lead to habitat loss as they are forced to move to higher
      elevations in search of suitable conditions. Studies have documented declines
      in pika populations in regions like the Great Basin, where warmer and drier
      conditions prevail.\\n\\nDespite these challenges, the US government decided
      in 2010 not to list the American pika under the Endangered Species Act. However,
      pikas remain a focal species for climate change research due to their sensitivity
      to environmental changes.\\n\\nEfforts to monitor and conserve pika populations
      include long-term studies and citizen science programs, which aim to track their
      distribution, behavior, and population trends. These initiatives are crucial
      for understanding the impacts of climate change and implementing effective conservation
      strategies.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\nPikas are fascinating small mammals with
      unique adaptations to cold alpine environments. Their behaviors, particularly
      their haying and social interactions, are integral to their survival. However,
      they face significant threats from climate change, which necessitates ongoing
      research and conservation efforts to ensure their persistence in a rapidly changing

      Research Report on Pikas\\n\\n#### Introduction\\nPikas are small, herbivorous
      mammals belonging to the family Ochotonidae within the order Lagomorpha, which
      also includes rabbits and hares. There are 30 recognized species of pikas, with
      the American pika (Ochotona princeps) and the collared pika (Ochotona collaris)
      being the two species found in North America. This report provides a comprehensive
      overview of pikas focusing on their habitat, diet, behavior, social structure,
      and conservation status.\\n\\n#### Habitat and Distribution\\nPikas inhabit
      cold climates, predominantly found in alpine and subalpine regions. Their distribution
      spans across the mountainous areas of western North America, from central British
      Columbia and Alberta in Canada to various states in the USA, including Oregon,
      Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, and
      New Mexico.\\n\\nPikas thrive in rocky terrains, such as talus slopes and meadows
      rich in vegetation, which provide both shelter and food. These environments
      are typically characterized by cooler temperatures, which are crucial for the
      survival of pikas. They are highly sensitive to temperature increases and are
      often used as indicators for the effects of climate change.\\n\\n#### Diet and
      Feeding Habits\\nPikas are generalist herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses,
      forbs, and small shrubs. They exhibit two primary foraging behaviors: direct
      consumption and caching of plants. The latter involves gathering and storing
      vegetation in \\\"haypiles\\\" to sustain them through the winter months when
      food is scarce.\\n\\nTheir diet is diverse, extending to various alpine meadow
      plants. During the summer, pikas actively collect and dry plant material, which
      they store in their dens or crevices between rocks. This \\\"haying\\\" behavior
      is critical for their winter survival, as they do not hibernate and rely on
      these stored food reserves.\\n\\n#### Behavior and Social Structure\\nPikas
      are diurnal and exhibit a range of social behaviors. While some species are
      solitary, others, like the Eurasian pikas, live in family groups and share responsibilities
      such as gathering food and keeping watch for predators. The social structure
      of pikas can influence their foraging behavior and territory establishment.\\n\\nPlateau
      pikas, for instance, show significant variation in their social complexity,
      with family groups demonstrating different social systems. Interactions within
      these groups can include cooperative behaviors as well as aggressive encounters,
      particularly among males from different families.\\n\\n#### Conservation Status\\nThe
      conservation status of pikas varies among species. The American pika, in particular,
      faces threats from global climate change. They are highly susceptible to temperature
      increases, which can lead to habitat loss as they are forced to move to higher
      elevations in search of suitable conditions. Studies have documented declines
      in pika populations in regions like the Great Basin, where warmer and drier
      conditions prevail.\\n\\nDespite these challenges, the US government decided
      in 2010 not to list the American pika under the Endangered Species Act. However,
      pikas remain a focal species for climate change research due to their sensitivity
      to environmental changes.\\n\\nEfforts to monitor and conserve pika populations
      include long-term studies and citizen science programs, which aim to track their
      distribution, behavior, and population trends. These initiatives are crucial
      for understanding the impacts of climate change and implementing effective conservation
      strategies.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\nPikas are fascinating small mammals with
      unique adaptations to cold alpine environments. Their behaviors, particularly
      their haying and social interactions, are integral to their survival. However,
      they face significant threats from climate change, which necessitates ongoing
      research and conservation efforts to ensure their persistence in a rapidly changing

      some populations are declining due to various factors, most notably global warming.[20]
      A 2003 study, published in the Journal of Mammalogy, showed nine of 25 sampled
      populations of American pika had been extirpated in the Great Basin, leading
      biologists to conduct further investigations to determine if the species as
      a whole is vulnerable.[23]\\\\nIn 2010, the US government considered, then decided
      not to add the American pika under the US Endangered Species Act.[24] The original
      scientific name was Lepus (Lagomys) princeps.[18]\\\\nConservation and decline[edit]\\\\nAs
      they live in the high and cooler mountain regions, they are very sensitive to
      high temperatures, and are considered to be one of the best early warning systems
      for detecting global warming in the western United States.[19]\\\\nTemperature
      increases are suspected to be one cause of American pikas moving higher in elevation[20]
      in an attempt to find suitable habitat, as well as cooler temperatures. Distribution
      and habitat[edit]\\\\nThe American pika can be found throughout the mountains
      of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada
      to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
      Nevada, California, and New Mexico.[10] Of the 30 existing species of pika,
      it is one of only two which inhabit North America, along with the collared pika
      (O. collaris). The project concluded in 2016.[26]\\\\nMore recent studies have
      found widespread extirpations and range retractions at lower elevations which
      are typically warmer and drier, patterns that have been further attributed to
      varying aspects of climate change such as warmer summer and winter temperatures
      and changes in precipitation.[27][28][29][30] For example, one study found upslope
      retractions in 44 of 64 watersheds surveyed in the Northern Rockies, with retractions
      averaging 281\_m (922\_ft).[31] Although a pika can meet its water demand from
      the vegetation eaten, it does drink water if it is available in its environment.[14]\\\\nPikas
      have two different ways of foraging; they directly consume food (feeding) or
      they cache food in haypiles to use for a food source in the winter (haying).[11]
      They feed throughout the year while haying is limited to the summer.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\":

      of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada
      to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
      Nevada, California, and New Mexico.[10] Of the 30 existing species of pika,

      I\\\\nCharacteristics of sites in the hydrological Great Basin, western United
      States, used in relevant analyses, 1994\u20132008, as presented by Beever et
      al. (2011:Appendix V), with calculations of range retraction. In this review
      I 1) review the paleontological history of the American pika in North America;
      2) outline why pikas are an exceptional species to study with regard to environmental
      change; 3) summarize relevant information on the status of pikas across the
      species\u2019 range; 4) highlight aspects of the resiliency of pikas living
      in extreme environments; 5) review how relevant traits of pikas may be impacted
      by environmental change; and 6) present the current conservation status of the
      pika. The mechanistic climatic models of Mathewson et al. (2017) correctly predicted
      the prehistoric retrenchment of pikas in the Great Basin, as well as the current
      distribution of pikas, but failed to account for the presence of pikas at Craters
      of the Moon, Lava Beds National Monument, Newberry National Volcanic Monument,
      or along the Columbia River Gorge (and presumably also at Bodie and the Mono
      Craters; collectively \u201Coutlier sites\u201D). Meanwhile, the pattern of
      occupancy in the northern constellation of patches, while variable from year
      to year, was unchanged; in fact, the documented number of pikas in the north
      in our 2009 and 2010 surveys exceeded the number of pikas counted in the north
      in 1972 or 1977 (Smith and Nagy 2015). Characteristics of Pikas in Stressful
      Environments\\\\nOur understanding of the current distribution and local abundance
      of American pika populations is contingent on a thorough understanding of the
      natural history of the species, notably missing from most of the contemporary
      work on pikas involving regional surveys.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9475130/\\\",

      Research Report on Pikas\\n\\n#### Introduction\\nPikas are small, herbivorous
      mammals belonging to the family Ochotonidae within the order Lagomorpha, which
      also includes rabbits and hares. There are 30 recognized species of pikas, with
      the American pika (Ochotona princeps) and the collared pika (Ochotona collaris)
      being the two species found in North America. This report provides a comprehensive
      overview of pikas focusing on their habitat, diet, behavior, social structure,
      and conservation status.\\n\\n#### Habitat and Distribution\\nPikas inhabit
      cold climates, predominantly found in alpine and subalpine regions. Their distribution
      spans across the mountainous areas of western North America, from central British
      Columbia and Alberta in Canada to various states in the USA, including Oregon,
      Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, and
      New Mexico.\\n\\nPikas thrive in rocky terrains, such as talus slopes and meadows
      rich in vegetation, which provide both shelter and food. These environments
      are typically characterized by cooler temperatures, which are crucial for the
      survival of pikas. They are highly sensitive to temperature increases and are
      often used as indicators for the effects of climate change.\\n\\n#### Diet and
      Feeding Habits\\nPikas are generalist herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses,
      forbs, and small shrubs. They exhibit two primary foraging behaviors: direct
      consumption and caching of plants. The latter involves gathering and storing
      vegetation in \\\"haypiles\\\" to sustain them through the winter months when
      food is scarce.\\n\\nTheir diet is diverse, extending to various alpine meadow
      plants. During the summer, pikas actively collect and dry plant material, which
      they store in their dens or crevices between rocks. This \\\"haying\\\" behavior
      is critical for their winter survival, as they do not hibernate and rely on
      these stored food reserves.\\n\\n#### Behavior and Social Structure\\nPikas
      are diurnal and exhibit a range of social behaviors. While some species are
      solitary, others, like the Eurasian pikas, live in family groups and share responsibilities
      such as gathering food and keeping watch for predators. The social structure
      of pikas can influence their foraging behavior and territory establishment.\\n\\nPlateau
      pikas, for instance, show significant variation in their social complexity,
      with family groups demonstrating different social systems. Interactions within
      these groups can include cooperative behaviors as well as aggressive encounters,
      particularly among males from different families.\\n\\n#### Conservation Status\\nThe
      conservation status of pikas varies among species. The American pika, in particular,
      faces threats from global climate change. They are highly susceptible to temperature
      increases, which can lead to habitat loss as they are forced to move to higher
      elevations in search of suitable conditions. Studies have documented declines
      in pika populations in regions like the Great Basin, where warmer and drier
      conditions prevail.\\n\\nDespite these challenges, the US government decided
      in 2010 not to list the American pika under the Endangered Species Act. However,
      pikas remain a focal species for climate change research due to their sensitivity
      to environmental changes.\\n\\nEfforts to monitor and conserve pika populations
      include long-term studies and citizen science programs, which aim to track their
      distribution, behavior, and population trends. These initiatives are crucial
      for understanding the impacts of climate change and implementing effective conservation
      strategies.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\nPikas are fascinating small mammals with
      unique adaptations to cold alpine environments. Their behaviors, particularly
      their haying and social interactions, are integral to their survival. However,

      and extreme maximum surface temperatures in August at these sites are 32 and
      38\_\xB0C (90 and 100\_\xB0F), respectively.[22]\\\\nRecent studies suggest
      some populations are declining due to various factors, most notably global warming.[20]
      A 2003 study, published in the Journal of Mammalogy, showed nine of 25 sampled
      populations of American pika had been extirpated in the Great Basin, leading
      biologists to conduct further investigations to determine if the species as
      a whole is vulnerable.[23]\\\\nIn 2010, the US government considered, then decided
      not to add the American pika under the US Endangered Species Act.[24] The original
      scientific name was Lepus (Lagomys) princeps.[18]\\\\nConservation and decline[edit]\\\\nAs
      they live in the high and cooler mountain regions, they are very sensitive to
      high temperatures, and are considered to be one of the best early warning systems
      for detecting global warming in the western United States.[19]\\\\nTemperature
      increases are suspected to be one cause of American pikas moving higher in elevation[20]
      in an attempt to find suitable habitat, as well as cooler temperatures. Distribution
      and habitat[edit]\\\\nThe American pika can be found throughout the mountains
      of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada
      to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
      Nevada, California, and New Mexico.[10] Of the 30 existing species of pika,
      it is one of only two which inhabit North America, along with the collared pika
      (O. collaris). The project concluded in 2016.[26]\\\\nMore recent studies have
      found widespread extirpations and range retractions at lower elevations which
      are typically warmer and drier, patterns that have been further attributed to
      varying aspects of climate change such as warmer summer and winter temperatures
      and changes in precipitation.[27][28][29][30] For example, one study found upslope
      retractions in 44 of 64 watersheds surveyed in the Northern Rockies, with retractions
      averaging 281\_m (922\_ft).[31] Although a pika can meet its water demand from
      the vegetation eaten, it does drink water if it is available in its environment.[14]\\\\nPikas
      have two different ways of foraging; they directly consume food (feeding) or
      they cache food in haypiles to use for a food source in the winter (haying).[11]
      They feed throughout the year while haying is limited to the summer.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\":
      \\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pika\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Pikas do not
      hibernate and remain active throughout the winter by traveling in tunnels under
      rocks and snow and eating dried plants that they have stored.[14] Rock-dwelling
      pikas exhibit two methods of foraging: the first involves direct consumption
      of food, and the second is characterized by the gathering of plants to store
      in a \\\\\\\"haypile\\\\\\\" of cached plants.[15]\\\\nThe impact of human activity
      on the tundra ecosystems where pikas live has been recorded dating back to the
      1970s.[16] Rather than hibernate during winter, pikas forage for grasses and
      other forms of plant matter and stash these findings in protected dens in a
      process called \\\\\\\"haying\\\\\\\".\\\\n Such interactions with humans have
      been linked to pikas having reduced amounts of foraging time, consequentially
      limiting the amount of food they can stockpile for winter months.[18] Pikas
      prefer foraging in temperatures below 25\_\xB0C (77\_\xB0F), so they generally
      spend their time in shaded regions and out of direct sunlight when temperatures
      are high.[18] A link has also been found between temperature increases and lost
      foraging time, where for every increase of 1\_\xB0C (1.8\_\xB0F) to the ambient
      temperature in alpine landscapes home to pikas, those pikas lose 3% of their
      foraging time.[18]\\\\nEurasian pikas commonly live in family groups and share
      duties of gathering food and keeping watch. Pleistocene fossils of the extant
      steppe pika O. pusilla currently native to Asia have been found also in many
      countries of Europe from the United Kingdom to Russia and from Italy to Poland,
      and the Asiatic extant northern pika O. hyperborea in one location in the middle
      Pleistocene United States.[1]\\\\nWhile Ochotona is the only currently living

      in the Ochotonidae, sometimes in Leporidae or in neither ochotonid nor leporid
      stem-lagomorphs.[36]\\\\nOchotonids appeared in Asia between the late Eocene

      I\\\\nCharacteristics of sites in the hydrological Great Basin, western United
      States, used in relevant analyses, 1994\u20132008, as presented by Beever et
      al. (2011:Appendix V), with calculations of range retraction. In this review
      I 1) review the paleontological history of the American pika in North America;
      2) outline why pikas are an exceptional species to study with regard to environmental
      change; 3) summarize relevant information on the status of pikas across the
      species\u2019 range; 4) highlight aspects of the resiliency of pikas living
      in extreme environments; 5) review how relevant traits of pikas may be impacted
      by environmental change; and 6) present the current conservation status of the
      pika. The mechanistic climatic models of Mathewson et al. (2017) correctly predicted
      the prehistoric retrenchment of pikas in the Great Basin, as well as the current
      distribution of pikas, but failed to account for the presence of pikas at Craters
      of the Moon, Lava Beds National Monument, Newberry National Volcanic Monument,
      or along the Columbia River Gorge (and presumably also at Bodie and the Mono
      Craters; collectively \u201Coutlier sites\u201D). Meanwhile, the pattern of
      occupancy in the northern constellation of patches, while variable from year
      to year, was unchanged; in fact, the documented number of pikas in the north
      in our 2009 and 2010 surveys exceeded the number of pikas counted in the north
      in 1972 or 1977 (Smith and Nagy 2015). Characteristics of Pikas in Stressful
      Environments\\\\nOur understanding of the current distribution and local abundance
      of American pika populations is contingent on a thorough understanding of the
      natural history of the species, notably missing from most of the contemporary
      work on pikas involving regional surveys.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9475130/\\\",
      \\\"content\\\": \\\"Our observations in 2021 of pikas on the Noonday Mine,
      coupled with those of pika occupancy on the Red Cloud Mine and the Booker Consolidated
      shaft (Klingler,\_2017; Nichols et al.,\_2016), indicate that following nearly
      a decade of extirpated status, there have been multiple re\u2010colonization
      episodes from the northern constellation to the southern constellation.\\\\n2.2.
      Nichols et al.\_(2016, p. 167\u2013168) mention seeing a pika in 2015 at an
      undisclosed site 1.2\_km from \u201Cthe nearest occupied patch\u201D \u2013
      most likely the Red Cloud Mine, 400\u2009m from the Noonday Mine (thus, the
      contention earlier in Nichols et al.,\_2016 that the southern constellation
      was extirpated at that time was incorrect). Although we know of only one other
      occupied site at the south end of the Craters, the potential exists for other
      active pika sites near NMCR that could have been the source for the re\u2010colonization
      observed in 2021 \u2013 such as the apparently transient individual observed
      via our camera trap in 2018 (Millar & Hickman,\_2021). At the far north end
      of the Mono Craters, 7\_km from the Pumice Mine site, Millar (Millar & Hickman,\_2021;
      Millar et al.,\_2013; C. I. Millar, unpublished observations) has been monitoring

      analyses, 1994\u20132008, as presented by Beever et al. (2011:Appendix V), with
      calculations of range retraction. In this review I 1) review the paleontological
      history of the American pika in North America; 2) outline why pikas are an exceptional
      species to study with regard to environmental change; 3) summarize relevant
      information on the status of pikas across the species\u2019 range; 4) highlight
      aspects of the resiliency of pikas living in extreme environments; 5) review
      how relevant traits of pikas may be impacted by environmental change; and 6)
      present the current conservation status of the pika. The mechanistic climatic
      models of Mathewson et al. (2017) correctly predicted the prehistoric retrenchment
      of pikas in the Great Basin, as well as the current distribution of pikas, but
      failed to account for the presence of pikas at Craters of the Moon, Lava Beds
      National Monument, Newberry National Volcanic Monument, or along the Columbia
      River Gorge (and presumably also at Bodie and the Mono Craters; collectively
      \u201Coutlier sites\u201D). Meanwhile, the pattern of occupancy in the northern
      constellation of patches, while variable from year to year, was unchanged; in
      fact, the documented number of pikas in the north in our 2009 and 2010 surveys
      exceeded the number of pikas counted in the north in 1972 or 1977 (Smith and
      Nagy 2015). Characteristics of Pikas in Stressful Environments\\nOur understanding
      of the current distribution and local abundance of American pika populations
      is contingent on a thorough understanding of the natural history of the species,
      notably missing from most of the contemporary work on pikas involving regional
      surveys.\",\"score\":0.9558167,\"raw_content\":null},{\"title\":\"Return of

      Research Report on Pikas\\n\\n#### Introduction\\nPikas are small, herbivorous
      mammals belonging to the family Ochotonidae within the order Lagomorpha, which
      also includes rabbits and hares. There are 30 recognized species of pikas, with
      the American pika (Ochotona princeps) and the collared pika (Ochotona collaris)
      being the two species found in North America. This report provides a comprehensive
      overview of pikas focusing on their habitat, diet, behavior, social structure,
      and conservation status.\\n\\n#### Habitat and Distribution\\nPikas inhabit
      cold climates, predominantly found in alpine and subalpine regions. Their distribution
      spans across the mountainous areas of western North America, from central British
      Columbia and Alberta in Canada to various states in the USA, including Oregon,
      Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, and
      New Mexico.\\n\\nPikas thrive in rocky terrains, such as talus slopes and meadows
      rich in vegetation, which provide both shelter and food. These environments
      are typically characterized by cooler temperatures, which are crucial for the
      survival of pikas. They are highly sensitive to temperature increases and are
      often used as indicators for the effects of climate change.\\n\\n#### Diet and
      Feeding Habits\\nPikas are generalist herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses,
      forbs, and small shrubs. They exhibit two primary foraging behaviors: direct
      consumption and caching of plants. The latter involves gathering and storing
      vegetation in \\\"haypiles\\\" to sustain them through the winter months when
      food is scarce.\\n\\nTheir diet is diverse, extending to various alpine meadow
      plants. During the summer, pikas actively collect and dry plant material, which
      they store in their dens or crevices between rocks. This \\\"haying\\\" behavior
      is critical for their winter survival, as they do not hibernate and rely on
      these stored food reserves.\\n\\n#### Behavior and Social Structure\\nPikas
      are diurnal and exhibit a range of social behaviors. While some species are
      solitary, others, like the Eurasian pikas, live in family groups and share responsibilities
      such as gathering food and keeping watch for predators. The social structure
      of pikas can influence their foraging behavior and territory establishment.\\n\\nPlateau
      pikas, for instance, show significant variation in their social complexity,
      with family groups demonstrating different social systems. Interactions within
      these groups can include cooperative behaviors as well as aggressive encounters,
      particularly among males from different families.\\n\\n#### Conservation Status\\nThe
      conservation status of pikas varies among species. The American pika, in particular,
      faces threats from global climate change. They are highly susceptible to temperature
      increases, which can lead to habitat loss as they are forced to move to higher
      elevations in search of suitable conditions. Studies have documented declines
      in pika populations in regions like the Great Basin, where warmer and drier
      conditions prevail.\\n\\nDespite these challenges, the US government decided
      in 2010 not to list the American pika under the Endangered Species Act. However,
      pikas remain a focal species for climate change research due to their sensitivity
      to environmental changes.\\n\\nEfforts to monitor and conserve pika populations
      include long-term studies and citizen science programs, which aim to track their
      distribution, behavior, and population trends. These initiatives are crucial
      for understanding the impacts of climate change and implementing effective conservation
      strategies.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\nPikas are fascinating small mammals with
      unique adaptations to cold alpine environments. Their behaviors, particularly
      their haying and social interactions, are integral to their survival. However,
      they face significant threats from climate change, which necessitates ongoing
      research and conservation efforts to ensure their persistence in a rapidly changing
      world.\",\"additional_kwargs\":{\"refusal\":null},\"response_metadata\":{\"token_usage\":{\"completion_tokens\":725,\"prompt_tokens\":6238,\"total_tokens\":6963,\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"reasoning_tokens\":0}},\"model_name\":\"gpt-4o-2024-05-13\",\"system_fingerprint\":\"fp_e375328146\",\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"logprobs\":null},\"type\":\"ai\",\"id\":\"run-9eabbdb2-e461-496f-bb5e-fe94f9bc7cdb-0\",\"example\":false,\"tool_calls\":[],\"invalid_tool_calls\":[],\"usage_metadata\":{\"input_tokens\":6238,\"output_tokens\":725,\"total_tokens\":6963}}]},\"events\":[{\"name\":\"end\",\"time\":\"2024-09-19T17:47:39.435303+00:00\"}]},{\"id\":\"7b703354-5e0f-48b3-94c6-240298e68378\",\"name\":\"call_model\",\"trace_id\":\"e8f0ef86-def4-421b-b71e-78cf30aa2da8\",\"parent_run_id\":\"c4cb096b-1d00-4a64-999c-7b6bff28f0d7\",\"dotted_order\":\"20240919T174659869976Ze8f0ef86-def4-421b-b71e-78cf30aa2da8.20240919T174700229115Z90299fde-3aa9-488f-aee8-2e14a45a24ab.20240919T174700229806Z7642e531-8bc0-4eb9-8d08-f6e5d7be0cfe.20240919T174704526528Zc4cb096b-1d00-4a64-999c-7b6bff28f0d7.20240919T174704527124Z7b703354-5e0f-48b3-94c6-240298e68378\",\"tags\":[\"seq:step:1\"],\"extra\":{\"metadata\":{\"langgraph_step\":3,\"langgraph_node\":\"agent\",\"langgraph_triggers\":[\"tools\"],\"langgraph_path\":[\"__pregel_pull\",\"agent\"],\"langgraph_checkpoint_ns\":\"Researcher:a574f3d5-1f2b-4bcd-7750-5f61c7d1d6fd|agent:a6137ac6-56c2-a847-e31c-f87ae281983d\",\"checkpoint_ns\":\"Researcher:a574f3d5-1f2b-4bcd-7750-5f61c7d1d6fd\",\"revision_id\":\"checkpoint==1.0.10-68-g22fa527b-dirty\"},\"runtime\":{\"sdk\":\"langsmith-py\",\"sdk_version\":\"0.1.123\",\"library\":\"langsmith\",\"platform\":\"macOS-14.5-arm64-arm-64bit\",\"runtime\":\"python\",\"py_implementation\":\"CPython\",\"runtime_version\":\"3.12.4\",\"langchain_version\":\"0.3.0\",\"langchain_core_version\":\"0.3.1\"}},\"end_time\":\"2024-09-19T17:47:39.432391+00:00\",\"inputs\":{\"messages\":[{\"content\":\"Write

      they live in the high and cooler mountain regions, they are very sensitive to
      high temperatures, and are considered to be one of the best early warning systems
      for detecting global warming in the western United States.[19]\\\\nTemperature
      increases are suspected to be one cause of American pikas moving higher in elevation[20]
      in an attempt to find suitable habitat, as well as cooler temperatures. Distribution
      and habitat[edit]\\\\nThe American pika can be found throughout the mountains
      of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada
      to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
      Nevada, California, and New Mexico.[10] Of the 30 existing species of pika,
      it is one of only two which inhabit North America, along with the collared pika
      (O. collaris). The project concluded in 2016.[26]\\\\nMore recent studies have
      found widespread extirpations and range retractions at lower elevations which
      are typically warmer and drier, patterns that have been further attributed to
      varying aspects of climate change such as warmer summer and winter temperatures
      and changes in precipitation.[27][28][29][30] For example, one study found upslope
      retractions in 44 of 64 watersheds surveyed in the Northern Rockies, with retractions
      averaging 281\_m (922\_ft).[31] Although a pika can meet its water demand from
      the vegetation eaten, it does drink water if it is available in its environment.[14]\\\\nPikas
      have two different ways of foraging; they directly consume food (feeding) or
      they cache food in haypiles to use for a food source in the winter (haying).[11]
      They feed throughout the year while haying is limited to the summer.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\":
      \\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pika\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Pikas do not
      hibernate and remain active throughout the winter by traveling in tunnels under
      rocks and snow and eating dried plants that they have stored.[14] Rock-dwelling
      pikas exhibit two methods of foraging: the first involves direct consumption
      of food, and the second is characterized by the gathering of plants to store
      in a \\\\\\\"haypile\\\\\\\" of cached plants.[15]\\\\nThe impact of human activity
      on the tundra ecosystems where pikas live has been recorded dating back to the
      1970s.[16] Rather than hibernate during winter, pikas forage for grasses and
      other forms of plant matter and stash these findings in protected dens in a
      process called \\\\\\\"haying\\\\\\\".\\\\n Such interactions with humans have
      been linked to pikas having reduced amounts of foraging time, consequentially
      limiting the amount of food they can stockpile for winter months.[18] Pikas
      prefer foraging in temperatures below 25\_\xB0C (77\_\xB0F), so they generally
      spend their time in shaded regions and out of direct sunlight when temperatures
      are high.[18] A link has also been found between temperature increases and lost
      foraging time, where for every increase of 1\_\xB0C (1.8\_\xB0F) to the ambient
      temperature in alpine landscapes home to pikas, those pikas lose 3% of their
      foraging time.[18]\\\\nEurasian pikas commonly live in family groups and share
      duties of gathering food and keeping watch. Pleistocene fossils of the extant
      steppe pika O. pusilla currently native to Asia have been found also in many
      countries of Europe from the United Kingdom to Russia and from Italy to Poland,
      and the Asiatic extant northern pika O. hyperborea in one location in the middle
      Pleistocene United States.[1]\\\\nWhile Ochotona is the only currently living

      and extreme maximum surface temperatures in August at these sites are 32 and
      38\_\xB0C (90 and 100\_\xB0F), respectively.[22]\\nRecent studies suggest some
      populations are declining due to various factors, most notably global warming.[20]
      A 2003 study, published in the Journal of Mammalogy, showed nine of 25 sampled
      populations of American pika had been extirpated in the Great Basin, leading
      biologists to conduct further investigations to determine if the species as
      a whole is vulnerable.[23]\\nIn 2010, the US government considered, then decided
      not to add the American pika under the US Endangered Species Act.[24] The original
      scientific name was Lepus (Lagomys) princeps.[18]\\nConservation and decline[edit]\\nAs
      they live in the high and cooler mountain regions, they are very sensitive to
      high temperatures, and are considered to be one of the best early warning systems
      for detecting global warming in the western United States.[19]\\nTemperature
      increases are suspected to be one cause of American pikas moving higher in elevation[20]
      in an attempt to find suitable habitat, as well as cooler temperatures. Distribution
      and habitat[edit]\\nThe American pika can be found throughout the mountains
      of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada
      to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
      Nevada, California, and New Mexico.[10] Of the 30 existing species of pika,
      it is one of only two which inhabit North America, along with the collared pika
      (O. collaris). The project concluded in 2016.[26]\\nMore recent studies have
      found widespread extirpations and range retractions at lower elevations which
      are typically warmer and drier, patterns that have been further attributed to
      varying aspects of climate change such as warmer summer and winter temperatures
      and changes in precipitation.[27][28][29][30] For example, one study found upslope
      retractions in 44 of 64 watersheds surveyed in the Northern Rockies, with retractions
      averaging 281\_m (922\_ft).[31] Although a pika can meet its water demand from
      the vegetation eaten, it does drink water if it is available in its environment.[14]\\nPikas
      have two different ways of foraging; they directly consume food (feeding) or
      they cache food in haypiles to use for a food source in the winter (haying).[11]
      They feed throughout the year while haying is limited to the summer.\",\"score\":0.7112304,\"raw_content\":null}],\"response_time\":1.9},\"status\":\"success\"},{\"content\":\"[{\\\"url\\\":

      I\\\\nCharacteristics of sites in the hydrological Great Basin, western United
      States, used in relevant analyses, 1994\u20132008, as presented by Beever et
      al. (2011:Appendix V), with calculations of range retraction. In this review
      I 1) review the paleontological history of the American pika in North America;
      2) outline why pikas are an exceptional species to study with regard to environmental
      change; 3) summarize relevant information on the status of pikas across the
      species\u2019 range; 4) highlight aspects of the resiliency of pikas living
      in extreme environments; 5) review how relevant traits of pikas may be impacted
      by environmental change; and 6) present the current conservation status of the
      pika. The mechanistic climatic models of Mathewson et al. (2017) correctly predicted
      the prehistoric retrenchment of pikas in the Great Basin, as well as the current
      distribution of pikas, but failed to account for the presence of pikas at Craters
      of the Moon, Lava Beds National Monument, Newberry National Volcanic Monument,
      or along the Columbia River Gorge (and presumably also at Bodie and the Mono
      Craters; collectively \u201Coutlier sites\u201D). Meanwhile, the pattern of
      occupancy in the northern constellation of patches, while variable from year
      to year, was unchanged; in fact, the documented number of pikas in the north
      in our 2009 and 2010 surveys exceeded the number of pikas counted in the north
      in 1972 or 1977 (Smith and Nagy 2015). Characteristics of Pikas in Stressful
      Environments\\\\nOur understanding of the current distribution and local abundance
      of American pika populations is contingent on a thorough understanding of the
      natural history of the species, notably missing from most of the contemporary
      work on pikas involving regional surveys.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9475130/\\\",
      \\\"content\\\": \\\"Our observations in 2021 of pikas on the Noonday Mine,
      coupled with those of pika occupancy on the Red Cloud Mine and the Booker Consolidated
      shaft (Klingler,\_2017; Nichols et al.,\_2016), indicate that following nearly
      a decade of extirpated status, there have been multiple re\u2010colonization
      episodes from the northern constellation to the southern constellation.\\\\n2.2.
      Nichols et al.\_(2016, p. 167\u2013168) mention seeing a pika in 2015 at an
      undisclosed site 1.2\_km from \u201Cthe nearest occupied patch\u201D \u2013
      most likely the Red Cloud Mine, 400\u2009m from the Noonday Mine (thus, the
      contention earlier in Nichols et al.,\_2016 that the southern constellation
      was extirpated at that time was incorrect). Although we know of only one other
      occupied site at the south end of the Craters, the potential exists for other
      active pika sites near NMCR that could have been the source for the re\u2010colonization
      observed in 2021 \u2013 such as the apparently transient individual observed
      via our camera trap in 2018 (Millar & Hickman,\_2021). At the far north end
      of the Mono Craters, 7\_km from the Pumice Mine site, Millar (Millar & Hickman,\_2021;

      Figures\_1c and \u200Band2c).2c). C. I. Millar (unpublished surveys) has extensively
      explored talus habitat throughout the Mono Craters since 2009 using widely accepted
      methods for evaluating occupancy as follows: current occupancy of a talus (pika
      seen or heard and/or presence of current\u2010year haypile vegetation), former
      occupancy (only old haypile vegetation or dried, decomposing fecal pellets),
      or no indication of occupancy (none of these signs; Beever et al.,\_2003; Jeffress

      of sites in the hydrological Great Basin, western United States, used in relevant
      analyses, 1994\u20132008, as presented by Beever et al. (2011:Appendix V), with
      calculations of range retraction. In this review I 1) review the paleontological
      history of the American pika in North America; 2) outline why pikas are an exceptional
      species to study with regard to environmental change; 3) summarize relevant
      information on the status of pikas across the species\u2019 range; 4) highlight
      aspects of the resiliency of pikas living in extreme environments; 5) review
      how relevant traits of pikas may be impacted by environmental change; and 6)
      present the current conservation status of the pika. The mechanistic climatic
      models of Mathewson et al. (2017) correctly predicted the prehistoric retrenchment
      of pikas in the Great Basin, as well as the current distribution of pikas, but
      failed to account for the presence of pikas at Craters of the Moon, Lava Beds
      National Monument, Newberry National Volcanic Monument, or along the Columbia
      River Gorge (and presumably also at Bodie and the Mono Craters; collectively
      \u201Coutlier sites\u201D). Meanwhile, the pattern of occupancy in the northern
      constellation of patches, while variable from year to year, was unchanged; in
      fact, the documented number of pikas in the north in our 2009 and 2010 surveys
      exceeded the number of pikas counted in the north in 1972 or 1977 (Smith and
      Nagy 2015). Characteristics of Pikas in Stressful Environments\\nOur understanding
      of the current distribution and local abundance of American pika populations
      is contingent on a thorough understanding of the natural history of the species,
      notably missing from most of the contemporary work on pikas involving regional
      surveys.\",\"score\":0.9558167,\"raw_content\":null},{\"title\":\"Return of

      Research Report on Pikas\\n\\n#### Introduction\\nPikas are small, herbivorous
      mammals belonging to the family Ochotonidae within the order Lagomorpha, which
      also includes rabbits and hares. There are 30 recognized species of pikas, with
      the American pika (Ochotona princeps) and the collared pika (Ochotona collaris)
      being the two species found in North America. This report provides a comprehensive
      overview of pikas focusing on their habitat, diet, behavior, social structure,
      and conservation status.\\n\\n#### Habitat and Distribution\\nPikas inhabit
      cold climates, predominantly found in alpine and subalpine regions. Their distribution
      spans across the mountainous areas of western North America, from central British
      Columbia and Alberta in Canada to various states in the USA, including Oregon,
      Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, and
      New Mexico.\\n\\nPikas thrive in rocky terrains, such as talus slopes and meadows
      rich in vegetation, which provide both shelter and food. These environments
      are typically characterized by cooler temperatures, which are crucial for the
      survival of pikas. They are highly sensitive to temperature increases and are
      often used as indicators for the effects of climate change.\\n\\n#### Diet and
      Feeding Habits\\nPikas are generalist herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses,
      forbs, and small shrubs. They exhibit two primary foraging behaviors: direct
      consumption and caching of plants. The latter involves gathering and storing
      vegetation in \\\"haypiles\\\" to sustain them through the winter months when
      food is scarce.\\n\\nTheir diet is diverse, extending to various alpine meadow
      plants. During the summer, pikas actively collect and dry plant material, which
      they store in their dens or crevices between rocks. This \\\"haying\\\" behavior
      is critical for their winter survival, as they do not hibernate and rely on
      these stored food reserves.\\n\\n#### Behavior and Social Structure\\nPikas
      are diurnal and exhibit a range of social behaviors. While some species are
      solitary, others, like the Eurasian pikas, live in family groups and share responsibilities
      such as gathering food and keeping watch for predators. The social structure
      of pikas can influence their foraging behavior and territory establishment.\\n\\nPlateau
      pikas, for instance, show significant variation in their social complexity,
      with family groups demonstrating different social systems. Interactions within
      these groups can include cooperative behaviors as well as aggressive encounters,
      particularly among males from different families.\\n\\n#### Conservation Status\\nThe
      conservation status of pikas varies among species. The American pika, in particular,
      faces threats from global climate change. They are highly susceptible to temperature
      increases, which can lead to habitat loss as they are forced to move to higher
      elevations in search of suitable conditions. Studies have documented declines
      in pika populations in regions like the Great Basin, where warmer and drier
      conditions prevail.\\n\\nDespite these challenges, the US government decided
      in 2010 not to list the American pika under the Endangered Species Act. However,
      pikas remain a focal species for climate change research due to their sensitivity
      to environmental changes.\\n\\nEfforts to monitor and conserve pika populations
      include long-term studies and citizen science programs, which aim to track their
      distribution, behavior, and population trends. These initiatives are crucial
      for understanding the impacts of climate change and implementing effective conservation
      strategies.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\nPikas are fascinating small mammals with
      unique adaptations to cold alpine environments. Their behaviors, particularly
      their haying and social interactions, are integral to their survival. However,
      they face significant threats from climate change, which necessitates ongoing
      research and conservation efforts to ensure their persistence in a rapidly changing
      world.\",\"additional_kwargs\":{\"refusal\":null},\"response_metadata\":{\"token_usage\":{\"completion_tokens\":725,\"prompt_tokens\":6238,\"total_tokens\":6963,\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"reasoning_tokens\":0}},\"model_name\":\"gpt-4o-2024-05-13\",\"system_fingerprint\":\"fp_e375328146\",\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"logprobs\":null},\"type\":\"ai\",\"id\":\"run-9eabbdb2-e461-496f-bb5e-fe94f9bc7cdb-0\",\"example\":false,\"tool_calls\":[],\"invalid_tool_calls\":[],\"usage_metadata\":{\"input_tokens\":6238,\"output_tokens\":725,\"total_tokens\":6963}}]},\"events\":[{\"name\":\"end\",\"time\":\"2024-09-19T17:47:39.432391+00:00\"}]},{\"id\":\"e80f202f-4242-4836-8d66-b2554deeb26f\",\"name\":\"RunnableSequence\",\"trace_id\":\"e8f0ef86-def4-421b-b71e-78cf30aa2da8\",\"parent_run_id\":\"7b703354-5e0f-48b3-94c6-240298e68378\",\"dotted_order\":\"20240919T174659869976Ze8f0ef86-def4-421b-b71e-78cf30aa2da8.20240919T174700229115Z90299fde-3aa9-488f-aee8-2e14a45a24ab.20240919T174700229806Z7642e531-8bc0-4eb9-8d08-f6e5d7be0cfe.20240919T174704526528Zc4cb096b-1d00-4a64-999c-7b6bff28f0d7.20240919T174704527124Z7b703354-5e0f-48b3-94c6-240298e68378.20240919T174704528045Ze80f202f-4242-4836-8d66-b2554deeb26f\",\"tags\":[],\"extra\":{\"metadata\":{\"langgraph_step\":3,\"langgraph_node\":\"agent\",\"langgraph_triggers\":[\"tools\"],\"langgraph_path\":[\"__pregel_pull\",\"agent\"],\"langgraph_checkpoint_ns\":\"Researcher:a574f3d5-1f2b-4bcd-7750-5f61c7d1d6fd|agent:a6137ac6-56c2-a847-e31c-f87ae281983d\",\"checkpoint_ns\":\"Researcher:a574f3d5-1f2b-4bcd-7750-5f61c7d1d6fd\",\"revision_id\":\"checkpoint==1.0.10-68-g22fa527b-dirty\"},\"runtime\":{\"sdk\":\"langsmith-py\",\"sdk_version\":\"0.1.123\",\"library\":\"langsmith\",\"platform\":\"macOS-14.5-arm64-arm-64bit\",\"runtime\":\"python\",\"py_implementation\":\"CPython\",\"runtime_version\":\"3.12.4\",\"langchain_version\":\"0.3.0\",\"langchain_core_version\":\"0.3.1\"}},\"end_time\":\"2024-09-19T17:47:39.432046+00:00\",\"inputs\":{\"messages\":[{\"content\":\"Write

      and extreme maximum surface temperatures in August at these sites are 32 and
      38\_\xB0C (90 and 100\_\xB0F), respectively.[22]\\\\nRecent studies suggest
      some populations are declining due to various factors, most notably global warming.[20]
      A 2003 study, published in the Journal of Mammalogy, showed nine of 25 sampled
      populations of American pika had been extirpated in the Great Basin, leading
      biologists to conduct further investigations to determine if the species as
      a whole is vulnerable.[23]\\\\nIn 2010, the US government considered, then decided
      not to add the American pika under the US Endangered Species Act.[24] The original
      scientific name was Lepus (Lagomys) princeps.[18]\\\\nConservation and decline[edit]\\\\nAs
      they live in the high and cooler mountain regions, they are very sensitive to
      high temperatures, and are considered to be one of the best early warning systems
      for detecting global warming in the western United States.[19]\\\\nTemperature
      increases are suspected to be one cause of American pikas moving higher in elevation[20]
      in an attempt to find suitable habitat, as well as cooler temperatures. Distribution
      and habitat[edit]\\\\nThe American pika can be found throughout the mountains
      of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada
      to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
      Nevada, California, and New Mexico.[10] Of the 30 existing species of pika,
      it is one of only two which inhabit North America, along with the collared pika
      (O. collaris). The project concluded in 2016.[26]\\\\nMore recent studies have
      found widespread extirpations and range retractions at lower elevations which
      are typically warmer and drier, patterns that have been further attributed to
      varying aspects of climate change such as warmer summer and winter temperatures
      and changes in precipitation.[27][28][29][30] For example, one study found upslope
      retractions in 44 of 64 watersheds surveyed in the Northern Rockies, with retractions
      averaging 281\_m (922\_ft).[31] Although a pika can meet its water demand from
      the vegetation eaten, it does drink water if it is available in its environment.[14]\\\\nPikas
      have two different ways of foraging; they directly consume food (feeding) or
      they cache food in haypiles to use for a food source in the winter (haying).[11]
      They feed throughout the year while haying is limited to the summer.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\":
      \\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pika\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Pikas do not
      hibernate and remain active throughout the winter by traveling in tunnels under
      rocks and snow and eating dried plants that they have stored.[14] Rock-dwelling
      pikas exhibit two methods of foraging: the first involves direct consumption
      of food, and the second is characterized by the gathering of plants to store
      in a \\\\\\\"haypile\\\\\\\" of cached plants.[15]\\\\nThe impact of human activity
      on the tundra ecosystems where pikas live has been recorded dating back to the
      1970s.[16] Rather than hibernate during winter, pikas forage for grasses and
      other forms of plant matter and stash these findings in protected dens in a
      process called \\\\\\\"haying\\\\\\\".\\\\n Such interactions with humans have
      been linked to pikas having reduced amounts of foraging time, consequentially
      limiting the amount of food they can stockpile for winter months.[18] Pikas
      prefer foraging in temperatures below 25\_\xB0C (77\_\xB0F), so they generally
      spend their time in shaded regions and out of direct sunlight when temperatures
      are high.[18] A link has also been found between temperature increases and lost
      foraging time, where for every increase of 1\_\xB0C (1.8\_\xB0F) to the ambient
      temperature in alpine landscapes home to pikas, those pikas lose 3% of their
      foraging time.[18]\\\\nEurasian pikas commonly live in family groups and share
      duties of gathering food and keeping watch. Pleistocene fossils of the extant
      steppe pika O. pusilla currently native to Asia have been found also in many
      countries of Europe from the United Kingdom to Russia and from Italy to Poland,
      and the Asiatic extant northern pika O. hyperborea in one location in the middle
      Pleistocene United States.[1]\\\\nWhile Ochotona is the only currently living

      in the Ochotonidae, sometimes in Leporidae or in neither ochotonid nor leporid
      stem-lagomorphs.[36]\\\\nOchotonids appeared in Asia between the late Eocene
      and the early Oligocene, and continued to develop along with increased distribution
      of C3 grasses in previously forest dominated areas under the \\\\\\\"climatic
      optimum\\\\\\\" from the late Oligocene to middle Miocene. The North American
      collared pika (O. collaris) and American pika (O. princeps) have been suggested
      to have descended from the same ancestor as the steppe pika (O. pusilla).[25]\\\\nThe

      populations are declining due to various factors, most notably global warming.[20]
      A 2003 study, published in the Journal of Mammalogy, showed nine of 25 sampled
      populations of American pika had been extirpated in the Great Basin, leading
      biologists to conduct further investigations to determine if the species as
      a whole is vulnerable.[23]\\nIn 2010, the US government considered, then decided
      not to add the American pika under the US Endangered Species Act.[24] The original
      scientific name was Lepus (Lagomys) princeps.[18]\\nConservation and decline[edit]\\nAs
      they live in the high and cooler mountain regions, they are very sensitive to
      high temperatures, and are considered to be one of the best early warning systems
      for detecting global warming in the western United States.[19]\\nTemperature
      increases are suspected to be one cause of American pikas moving higher in elevation[20]
      in an attempt to find suitable habitat, as well as cooler temperatures. Distribution
      and habitat[edit]\\nThe American pika can be found throughout the mountains
      of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada
      to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
      Nevada, California, and New Mexico.[10] Of the 30 existing species of pika,
      it is one of only two which inhabit North America, along with the collared pika
      (O. collaris). The project concluded in 2016.[26]\\nMore recent studies have
      found widespread extirpations and range retractions at lower elevations which
      are typically warmer and drier, patterns that have been further attributed to
      varying aspects of climate change such as warmer summer and winter temperatures
      and changes in precipitation.[27][28][29][30] For example, one study found upslope
      retractions in 44 of 64 watersheds surveyed in the Northern Rockies, with retractions
      averaging 281\_m (922\_ft).[31] Although a pika can meet its water demand from
      the vegetation eaten, it does drink water if it is available in its environment.[14]\\nPikas
      have two different ways of foraging; they directly consume food (feeding) or
      they cache food in haypiles to use for a food source in the winter (haying).[11]
      They feed throughout the year while haying is limited to the summer.\",\"score\":0.9972316,\"raw_content\":null},{\"title\":\"Pika
      - Wikipedia\",\"url\":\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pika\",\"content\":\"Pikas
      do not hibernate and remain active throughout the winter by traveling in tunnels
      under rocks and snow and eating dried plants that they have stored.[14] Rock-dwelling
      pikas exhibit two methods of foraging: the first involves direct consumption
      of food, and the second is characterized by the gathering of plants to store
      in a \\\"haypile\\\" of cached plants.[15]\\nThe impact of human activity on
      the tundra ecosystems where pikas live has been recorded dating back to the
      1970s.[16] Rather than hibernate during winter, pikas forage for grasses and
      other forms of plant matter and stash these findings in protected dens in a
      process called \\\"haying\\\".\\n Such interactions with humans have been linked
      to pikas having reduced amounts of foraging time, consequentially limiting the
      amount of food they can stockpile for winter months.[18] Pikas prefer foraging
      in temperatures below 25\_\xB0C (77\_\xB0F), so they generally spend their time
      in shaded regions and out of direct sunlight when temperatures are high.[18]
      A link has also been found between temperature increases and lost foraging time,
      where for every increase of 1\_\xB0C (1.8\_\xB0F) to the ambient temperature
      in alpine landscapes home to pikas, those pikas lose 3% of their foraging time.[18]\\nEurasian
      pikas commonly live in family groups and share duties of gathering food and
      keeping watch. Pleistocene fossils of the extant steppe pika O. pusilla currently
      native to Asia have been found also in many countries of Europe from the United
      Kingdom to Russia and from Italy to Poland, and the Asiatic extant northern
      pika O. hyperborea in one location in the middle Pleistocene United States.[1]\\nWhile
      Ochotona is the only currently living genus of Ochotonidae, extinct genera of
      ochotonids include\\n\u2020Albertona, \u2020Alloptox, \u2020Amphilagus, \u2020Australagomys,

      \u2020Russellagus, \u2020Sinolagomys and \u2020Titanomys.[1] The earliest one
      is Desmatolagus (middle Eocene to Miocene, 42.5\u201314.8 Ma[1]), usually included
      in the Ochotonidae, sometimes in Leporidae or in neither ochotonid nor leporid
      stem-lagomorphs.[36]\\nOchotonids appeared in Asia between the late Eocene and
      the early Oligocene, and continued to develop along with increased distribution
      of C3 grasses in previously forest dominated areas under the \\\"climatic optimum\\\"
      from the late Oligocene to middle Miocene. The North American collared pika
      (O. collaris) and American pika (O. princeps) have been suggested to have descended
      from the same ancestor as the steppe pika (O. pusilla).[25]\\nThe range of Ochotona

      States, used in relevant analyses, 1994\u20132008, as presented by Beever et
      al. (2011:Appendix V), with calculations of range retraction. In this review
      I 1) review the paleontological history of the American pika in North America;
      2) outline why pikas are an exceptional species to study with regard to environmental
      change; 3) summarize relevant information on the status of pikas across the
      species\u2019 range; 4) highlight aspects of the resiliency of pikas living
      in extreme environments; 5) review how relevant traits of pikas may be impacted
      by environmental change; and 6) present the current conservation status of the
      pika. The mechanistic climatic models of Mathewson et al. (2017) correctly predicted
      the prehistoric retrenchment of pikas in the Great Basin, as well as the current
      distribution of pikas, but failed to account for the presence of pikas at Craters
      of the Moon, Lava Beds National Monument, Newberry National Volcanic Monument,
      or along the Columbia River Gorge (and presumably also at Bodie and the Mono
      Craters; collectively \u201Coutlier sites\u201D). Meanwhile, the pattern of
      occupancy in the northern constellation of patches, while variable from year
      to year, was unchanged; in fact, the documented number of pikas in the north
      in our 2009 and 2010 surveys exceeded the number of pikas counted in the north
      in 1972 or 1977 (Smith and Nagy 2015). Characteristics of Pikas in Stressful
      Environments\\\\nOur understanding of the current distribution and local abundance
      of American pika populations is contingent on a thorough understanding of the
      natural history of the species, notably missing from most of the contemporary

      Research Report on Pikas\\n\\n#### Introduction\\nPikas are small, herbivorous
      mammals belonging to the family Ochotonidae within the order Lagomorpha, which
      also includes rabbits and hares. There are 30 recognized species of pikas, with
      the American pika (Ochotona princeps) and the collared pika (Ochotona collaris)
      being the two species found in North America. This report provides a comprehensive
      overview of pikas focusing on their habitat, diet, behavior, social structure,
      and conservation status.\\n\\n#### Habitat and Distribution\\nPikas inhabit
      cold climates, predominantly found in alpine and subalpine regions. Their distribution
      spans across the mountainous areas of western North America, from central British
      Columbia and Alberta in Canada to various states in the USA, including Oregon,
      Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, and
      New Mexico.\\n\\nPikas thrive in rocky terrains, such as talus slopes and meadows
      rich in vegetation, which provide both shelter and food. These environments
      are typically characterized by cooler temperatures, which are crucial for the
      survival of pikas. They are highly sensitive to temperature increases and are
      often used as indicators for the effects of climate change.\\n\\n#### Diet and
      Feeding Habits\\nPikas are generalist herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses,
      forbs, and small shrubs. They exhibit two primary foraging behaviors: direct
      consumption and caching of plants. The latter involves gathering and storing
      vegetation in \\\"haypiles\\\" to sustain them through the winter months when
      food is scarce.\\n\\nTheir diet is diverse, extending to various alpine meadow
      plants. During the summer, pikas actively collect and dry plant material, which
      they store in their dens or crevices between rocks. This \\\"haying\\\" behavior
      is critical for their winter survival, as they do not hibernate and rely on
      these stored food reserves.\\n\\n#### Behavior and Social Structure\\nPikas
      are diurnal and exhibit a range of social behaviors. While some species are
      solitary, others, like the Eurasian pikas, live in family groups and share responsibilities
      such as gathering food and keeping watch for predators. The social structure
      of pikas can influence their foraging behavior and territory establishment.\\n\\nPlateau
      pikas, for instance, show significant variation in their social complexity,
      with family groups demonstrating different social systems. Interactions within
      these groups can include cooperative behaviors as well as aggressive encounters,
      particularly among males from different families.\\n\\n#### Conservation Status\\nThe
      conservation status of pikas varies among species. The American pika, in particular,
      faces threats from global climate change. They are highly susceptible to temperature
      increases, which can lead to habitat loss as they are forced to move to higher
      elevations in search of suitable conditions. Studies have documented declines
      in pika populations in regions like the Great Basin, where warmer and drier
      conditions prevail.\\n\\nDespite these challenges, the US government decided
      in 2010 not to list the American pika under the Endangered Species Act. However,
      pikas remain a focal species for climate change research due to their sensitivity
      to environmental changes.\\n\\nEfforts to monitor and conserve pika populations
      include long-term studies and citizen science programs, which aim to track their
      distribution, behavior, and population trends. These initiatives are crucial
      for understanding the impacts of climate change and implementing effective conservation
      strategies.\\n\\n#### Conclusion\\nPikas are fascinating small mammals with
      unique adaptations to cold alpine environments. Their behaviors, particularly
      their haying and social interactions, are integral to their survival. However,
      they face significant threats from climate change, which necessitates ongoing
      research and conservation efforts to ensure their persistence in a rapidly changing
      world.\",\"additional_kwargs\":{\"refusal\":null},\"response_metadata\":{\"token_usage\":{\"completion_tokens\":725,\"prompt_tokens\":6238,\"total_tokens\":6963,\"completion_tokens_details\":{\"reasoning_tokens\":0}},\"model_name\":\"gpt-4o-2024-05-13\",\"system_fingerprint\":\"fp_e375328146\",\"finish_reason\":\"stop\",\"logprobs\":null},\"type\":\"ai\",\"id\":\"run-9eabbdb2-e461-496f-bb5e-fe94f9bc7cdb-0\",\"example\":false,\"tool_calls\":[],\"invalid_tool_calls\":[],\"usage_metadata\":{\"input_tokens\":6238,\"output_tokens\":725,\"total_tokens\":6963}}},\"events\":[{\"name\":\"end\",\"time\":\"2024-09-19T17:47:39.432046+00:00\"}]},{\"id\":\"9eabbdb2-e461-496f-bb5e-fe94f9bc7cdb\",\"name\":\"ChatOpenAI\",\"trace_id\":\"e8f0ef86-def4-421b-b71e-78cf30aa2da8\",\"parent_run_id\":\"e80f202f-4242-4836-8d66-b2554deeb26f\",\"dotted_order\":\"20240919T174659869976Ze8f0ef86-def4-421b-b71e-78cf30aa2da8.20240919T174700229115Z90299fde-3aa9-488f-aee8-2e14a45a24ab.20240919T174700229806Z7642e531-8bc0-4eb9-8d08-f6e5d7be0cfe.20240919T174704526528Zc4cb096b-1d00-4a64-999c-7b6bff28f0d7.20240919T174704527124Z7b703354-5e0f-48b3-94c6-240298e68378.20240919T174704528045Ze80f202f-4242-4836-8d66-b2554deeb26f.20240919T174704530070Z9eabbdb2-e461-496f-bb5e-fe94f9bc7cdb\",\"tags\":[\"seq:step:2\"],\"extra\":{\"invocation_params\":{\"model\":\"gpt-4o\",\"model_name\":\"gpt-4o\",\"stream\":false,\"n\":1,\"temperature\":0.7,\"_type\":\"openai-chat\",\"stop\":null,\"tools\":[{\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"tavily_search_results_json\",\"description\":\"A

      38\_\xB0C (90 and 100\_\xB0F), respectively.[22]\\\\nRecent studies suggest
      some populations are declining due to various factors, most notably global warming.[20]
      A 2003 study, published in the Journal of Mammalogy, showed nine of 25 sampled
      populations of American pika had been extirpated in the Great Basin, leading
      biologists to conduct further investigations to determine if the species as
      a whole is vulnerable.[23]\\\\nIn 2010, the US government considered, then decided
      not to add the American pika under the US Endangered Species Act.[24] The original
      scientific name was Lepus (Lagomys) princeps.[18]\\\\nConservation and decline[edit]\\\\nAs
      they live in the high and cooler mountain regions, they are very sensitive to
      high temperatures, and are considered to be one of the best early warning systems
      for detecting global warming in the western United States.[19]\\\\nTemperature
      increases are suspected to be one cause of American pikas moving higher in elevation[20]
      in an attempt to find suitable habitat, as well as cooler temperatures. Distribution
      and habitat[edit]\\\\nThe American pika can be found throughout the mountains
      of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada
      to the US states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah,
      Nevada, California, and New Mexico.[10] Of the 30 existing species of pika,
      it is one of only two which inhabit North America, along with the collared pika
      (O. collaris). The project concluded in 2016.[26]\\\\nMore recent studies have
      found widespread extirpations and range retractions at lower elevations which
      are typically warmer and drier, patterns that have been further attributed to
      varying aspects of climate change such as warmer summer and winter temperatures
      and changes in precipitation.[27][28][29][30] For example, one study found upslope
      retractions in 44 of 64 watersheds surveyed in the Northern Rockies, with retractions
      averaging 281\_m (922\_ft).[31] Although a pika can meet its water demand from
      the vegetation eaten, it does drink water if it is available in its environment.[14]\\\\nPikas
      have two different ways of foraging; they directly consume food (feeding) or
      they cache food in haypiles to use for a food source in the winter (haying).[11]
      They feed throughout the year while haying is limited to the summer.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\":
      \\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pika\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Pikas do not
      hibernate and remain active throughout the winter by traveling in tunnels under
      rocks and snow and eating dried plants that they have stored.[14] Rock-dwelling
      pikas exhibit two methods of foraging: the first involves direct consumption
      of food, and the second is characterized by the gathering of plants to store
      in a \\\\\\\"haypile\\\\\\\" of cached plants.[15]\\\\nThe impact of human activity
      on the tundra ecosystems where pikas live has been recorded dating back to the
      1970s.[16] Rather than hibernate during winter, pikas forage for grasses and
      other forms of plant matter and stash these findings in protected dens in a
      process called \\\\\\\"haying\\\\\\\".\\\\n Such interactions with humans have
      been linked to pikas having reduced amounts of foraging time, consequentially
      limiting the amount of food they can stockpile for winter months.[18] Pikas
      prefer foraging in temperatures below 25\_\xB0C (77\_\xB0F), so they generally
      spend their time in shaded regions and out of direct sunlight when temperatures
      are high.[18] A link has also been found between temperature increases and lost
      foraging time, where for every increase of 1\_\xB0C (1.8\_\xB0F) to the ambient
      temperature in alpine landscapes home to pikas, those pikas lose 3% of their
      foraging time.[18]\\\\nEurasian pikas commonly live in family groups and share
      duties of gathering food and keeping watch. Pleistocene fossils of the extant
      steppe pika O. pusilla currently native to Asia have been found also in many
      countries of Europe from the United Kingdom to Russia and from Italy to Poland,
      and the Asiatic extant northern pika O. hyperborea in one location in the middle
      Pleistocene United States.[1]\\\\nWhile Ochotona is the only currently living
      genus of Ochotonidae, extinct genera of ochotonids include\\\\n\u2020Albertona,

      is Desmatolagus (middle Eocene to Miocene, 42.5\u201314.8 Ma[1]), usually included
      in the Ochotonidae, sometimes in Leporidae or in neither ochotonid nor leporid
      stem-lagomorphs.[36]\\\\nOchotonids appeared in Asia between the late Eocene
      and the early Oligocene, and continued to develop along with increased distribution
      of C3 grasses in previously forest dominated areas under the \\\\\\\"climatic
      optimum\\\\\\\" from the late Oligocene to middle Miocene. The North American
      collared pika (O. collaris) and American pika (O. princeps) have been suggested
      to have descended from the same ancestor as the steppe pika (O. pusilla).[25]\\\\nThe

      do not hibernate and remain active throughout the winter by traveling in tunnels
      under rocks and snow and eating dried plants that they have stored.[14] Rock-dwelling
      pikas exhibit two methods of foraging: the first involves direct consumption
      of food, and the second is characterized by the gathering of plants to store
      in a \\\"haypile\\\" of cached plants.[15]\\nThe impact of human activity on
      the tundra ecosystems where pikas live has been recorded dating back to the
      1970s.[16] Rather than hibernate during winter, pikas forage for grasses and
      other forms of plant matter and stash these findings in protected dens in a
      process called \\\"haying\\\".\\n Such interactions with humans have been linked
      to pikas having reduced amounts of foraging time, consequentially limiting the
      amount of food they can stockpile for winter months.[18] Pikas prefer foraging
      in temperatures below 25\_\xB0C (77\_\xB0F), so they generally spend their time
      in shaded regions and out of direct sunlight when temperatures are high.[18]
      A link has also been found between temperature increases and lost foraging time,
      where for every increase of 1\_\xB0C (1.8\_\xB0F) to the ambient temperature
      in alpine landscapes home to pikas, those pikas lose 3% of their foraging time.[18]\\nEurasian
      pikas commonly live in family groups and share duties of gathering food and
      keeping watch. Pleistocene fossils of the extant steppe pika O. pusilla currently
      native to Asia have been found also in many countries of Europe from the United
      Kingdom to Russia and from Italy to Poland, and the Asiatic extant northern
      pika O. hyperborea in one location in the middle Pleistocene United States.[1]\\nWhile
      Ochotona is the only currently living genus of Ochotonidae, extinct genera of
      ochotonids include\\n\u2020Albertona, \u2020Alloptox, \u2020Amphilagus, \u2020Australagomys,

      is Desmatolagus (middle Eocene to Miocene, 42.5\u201314.8 Ma[1]), usually included
      in the Ochotonidae, sometimes in Leporidae or in neither ochotonid nor leporid
      stem-lagomorphs.[36]\\nOchotonids appeared in Asia between the late Eocene and
      the early Oligocene, and continued to develop along with increased distribution
      of C3 grasses in previously forest dominated areas under the \\\"climatic optimum\\\"
      from the late Oligocene to middle Miocene. The North American collared pika
      (O. collaris) and American pika (O. princeps) have been suggested to have descended
      from the same ancestor as the steppe pika (O. pusilla).[25]\\nThe range of Ochotona
      was larger in the past, with both extinct and extant species inhabiting Western
      Europe and Eastern North America, areas that are currently free of pikas.\",\"score\":0.9145963,\"raw_content\":null},{\"title\":\"Pikas

      of western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada

      States, used in relevant analyses, 1994\u20132008, as presented by Beever et
      al. (2011:Appendix V), with calculations of range retraction. In this review
      I 1) review the paleontological history of the American pika in North America;
      2) outline why pikas are an exceptional species to study with regard to environmental
      change; 3) summarize relevant information on the status of pikas across the
      species\u2019 range; 4) highlight aspects of the resiliency of pikas living
      in extreme environments; 5) review how relevant traits of pikas may be impacted
      by environmental change; and 6) present the current conservation status of the
      pika. The mechanistic climatic models of Mathewson et al. (2017) correctly predicted
      the prehistoric retrenchment of pikas in the Great Basin, as well as the current
      distribution of pikas, but failed to account for the presence of pikas at Craters
      of the Moon, Lava Beds National Monument, Newberry National Volcanic Monument,
      or along the Columbia River Gorge (and presumably also at Bodie and the Mono
      Craters; collectively \u201Coutlier sites\u201D). Meanwhile, the pattern of
      occupancy in the northern constellation of patches, while variable from year
      to year, was unchanged; in fact, the documented number of pikas in the north
      in our 2009 and 2010 surveys exceeded the number of pikas counted in the north
      in 1972 or 1977 (Smith and Nagy 2015). Characteristics of Pikas in Stressful
      Environments\\\\nOur understanding of the current distribution and local abundance
      of American pika populations is contingent on a thorough understanding of the
      natural history of the species, notably missing from most of the contemporary
      work on pikas involving regional surveys.\\\"}, {\\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9475130/\\\",

      Research Report on Pikas\\n\\n#### Introduction\\nPikas are small, herbivorous
      mammals belonging to the family Ochotonidae within the order Lagomorpha, which
      also includes rabbits and hares. There are 30 recognized species of pikas, with
      the American pika (Ochotona princeps) and the collared pika (Ochotona collaris)
      being the two species found in North America. This report provides a comprehensive
      overview of pikas focusing on their habitat, diet, behavior, social structure,
      and conservation status.\\n\\n#### Habitat and Distribution\\nPikas inhabit
      cold climates, predominantly found in alpine and subalpine regions. Their distribution
      spans across the mountainous areas of western North America, from central British
      Columbia and Alberta in Canada to various states in the USA, including Oregon,
      Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, and
      New Mexico.\\n\\nPikas thrive in rocky terrains, such as talus slopes and meadows
      rich in vegetation, which provide both shelter and food. These environments
      are typically characterized by cooler temperatures, which are crucial for the
      survival of pikas. They are highly sensitive to temperature increases and are
      often used as indicators for the effects of climate change.\\n\\n#### Diet and
      Feeding Habits\\nPikas are generalist herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses,
      forbs, and small shrubs. They exhibit two primary foraging behaviors: direct
      consumption and caching of plants. The latter involves gathering and storing
      vegetation in \\\"haypiles\\\" to sustain them through the winter months when
      food is scarce.\\n\\nTheir diet is diverse, extending to various alpine meadow
      plants. During the summer, pikas actively collect and dry plant material, which
      they store in their dens or crevices between rocks. This \\\"haying\\\" behavior
      is critical for their winter survival, as they do not hibernate and rely on
      these stored food reserves.\\n\\n#### Behavior and Social Structure\\nPikas
      are diurnal and exhibit a range of social behaviors. While some species are
      solitary, others, like the Eurasian pikas, live in family groups and share responsibilities
      such as gathering food and keeping watch for predators. The social structure
      of pikas can influence their foraging behavior and territory establishment.\\n\\nPlateau
      pikas, for instance, show significant variation in their social complexity,
      with family groups demonstrating different social systems. Interactions within
      these groups can include cooperative behaviors as well as aggressive encounters,
      particularly among males from different families.\\n\\n#### Conservation Status\\nThe
      conservation status of pikas varies among species. The American pika, in particular,
      faces threats from global climate change. They are highly susceptible to temperature
      increases, which can lead to habitat loss as they are forced to move to higher
      elevations in search of suitable conditions. Studies have documented declines
      in pika populations in regions like the Great Basin, where warmer and drier
      conditions prevail.\\n\\nDespite these challenges, the US government decided
      in 2010 not to list the American pika under the Endangered Species Act. However,

      Research Report on Pikas\\n\\n#### Introduction\\nPikas are small, herbivorous
      mammals belonging to the family Ochotonidae within the order Lagomorpha, which
      also includes rabbits and hares. There are 30 recognized species of pikas, with
      the American pika (Ochotona princeps) and the collared pika (Ochotona collaris)
      being the two species found in North America. This report provides a comprehensive
      overview of pikas focusing on their habitat, diet, behavior, social structure,
      and conservation status.\\n\\n#### Habitat and Distribution\\nPikas inhabit
      cold climates, predominantly found in alpine and subalpine regions. Their distribution
      spans across the mountainous areas of western North America, from central British
      Columbia and Alberta in Canada to various states in the USA, including Oregon,
      Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, and
      New Mexico.\\n\\nPikas thrive in rocky terrains, such as talus slopes and meadows
      rich in vegetation, which provide both shelter and food. These environments
      are typically characterized by cooler temperatures, which are crucial for the
      survival of pikas. They are highly sensitive to temperature increases and are
      often used as indicators for the effects of climate change.\\n\\n#### Diet and
      Feeding Habits\\nPikas are generalist herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses,
      forbs, and small shrubs. They exhibit two primary foraging behaviors: direct
      consumption and caching of plants. The latter involves gathering and storing
      vegetation in \\\"haypiles\\\" to sustain them through the winter months when
      food is scarce.\\n\\nTheir diet is diverse, extending to various alpine meadow
      plants. During the summer, pikas actively collect and dry plant material, which
      they store in their dens or crevices between rocks. This \\\"haying\\\" behavior
      is critical for their winter survival, as they do not hibernate and rely on
      these stored food reserves.\\n\\n#### Behavior and Social Structure\\nPikas
      are diurnal and exhibit a range of social behaviors. While some species are
      solitary, others, like the Eurasian pikas, live in family groups and share responsibilities
      such as gathering food and keeping watch for predators. The social structure
      of pikas can influence their foraging behavior and territory establishment.\\n\\nPlateau
      pikas, for instance, show significant variation in their social complexity,
      with family groups demonstrating different social systems. Interactions within
      these groups can include cooperative behaviors as well as aggressive encounters,
      particularly among males from different families.\\n\\n#### Conservation Status\\nThe
      conservation status of pikas varies among species. The American pika, in particular,
      faces threats from global climate change. They are highly susceptible to temperature
      increases, which can lead to habitat loss as they are forced to move to higher
      elevations in search of suitable conditions. Studies have documented declines
      in pika populations in regions like the Great Basin, where warmer and drier
      conditions prevail.\\n\\nDespite these challenges, the US government decided
      in 2010 not to list the American pika under the Endangered Species Act. However,
      pikas remain a focal species for climate change research due to their sensitivity
      to environmental changes.\\n\\nEfforts to monitor and conserve pika populations
      include long-term studies and citizen science programs, which aim to track their
      distribution, behavior, and population trends. These initiatives are crucial

      mammals belonging to the family Ochotonidae within the order Lagomorpha, which
      also includes rabbits and hares. There are 30 recognized species of pikas, with
      the American pika (Ochotona princeps) and the collared pika (Ochotona collaris)
      being the two species found in North America. This report provides a comprehensive
      overview of pikas focusing on their habitat, diet, behavior, social structure,
      and conservation status.\n\n#### Habitat and Distribution\nPikas inhabit cold
      climates, predominantly found in alpine and subalpine regions. Their distribution
      spans across the mountainous areas of western North America, from central British
      Columbia and Alberta in Canada to various states in the USA, including Oregon,
      Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, and
      New Mexico.\n\nPikas thrive in rocky terrains, such as talus slopes and meadows
      rich in vegetation, which provide both shelter and food. These environments
      are typically characterized by cooler temperatures, which are crucial for the
      survival of pikas. They are highly sensitive to temperature increases and are
      often used as indicators for the effects of climate change.\n\n#### Diet and
      Feeding Habits\nPikas are generalist herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses,
      forbs, and small shrubs. They exhibit two primary foraging behaviors: direct
      consumption and caching of plants. The latter involves gathering and storing
      vegetation in \"haypiles\" to sustain them through the winter months when food
      is scarce.\n\nTheir diet is diverse, extending to various alpine meadow plants.
      During the summer, pikas actively collect and dry plant material, which they
      store in their dens or crevices between rocks. This \"haying\" behavior is critical
      for their winter survival, as they do not hibernate and rely on these stored
      food reserves.\n\n#### Behavior and Social Structure\nPikas are diurnal and
      exhibit a range of social behaviors. While some species are solitary, others,
      like the Eurasian pikas, live in family groups and share responsibilities such
      as gathering food and keeping watch for predators. The social structure of pikas
      can influence their foraging behavior and territory establishment.\n\nPlateau
      pikas, for instance, show significant variation in their social complexity,
      with family groups demonstrating different social systems. Interactions within
      these groups can include cooperative behaviors as well as aggressive encounters,
      particularly among males from different families.\n\n#### Conservation Status\nThe
      conservation status of pikas varies among species. The American pika, in particular,
      faces threats from global climate change. They are highly susceptible to temperature
      increases, which can lead to habitat loss as they are forced to move to higher
      elevations in search of suitable conditions. Studies have documented declines
      in pika populations in regions like the Great Basin, where warmer and drier
      conditions prevail.\n\nDespite these challenges, the US government decided in
      2010 not to list the American pika under the Endangered Species Act. However,
      pikas remain a focal species for climate change research due to their sensitivity
      to environmental changes.\n\nEfforts to monitor and conserve pika populations
      include long-term studies and citizen science programs, which aim to track their
      distribution, behavior, and population trends. These initiatives are crucial
      for understanding the impacts of climate change and implementing effective conservation
      strategies.\n\n#### Conclusion\nPikas are fascinating small mammals with unique
      adaptations to cold alpine environments. Their behaviors, particularly their
      haying and social interactions, are integral to their survival. However, they
      face significant threats from climate change, which necessitates ongoing research
      and conservation efforts to ensure their persistence in a rapidly changing world.","additional_kwargs":{},"response_metadata":{},"type":"human","name":"Researcher","id":"ee305a9e-8b8c-41b1-8853-83943bc1a61a","example":false}],"next":"Coder"},"run_type":"chain"},{"id":"ef471c5a-90c6-492e-a40c-dc4e8c4c9035","start_time":"2024-09-19T17:47:40.278041+00:00","end_time":null,"extra":{"metadata":{"langgraph_step":4,"langgraph_node":"Coder","langgraph_triggers":["branch:supervisor:condition:Coder"],"langgraph_path":["__pregel_pull","Coder"],"langgraph_checkpoint_ns":"Coder:ed449e2b-4db4-5343-f23f-a128e1b3c814","revision_id":"checkpoint==1.0.10-68-g22fa527b-dirty"},"runtime":{"sdk":"langsmith-py","sdk_version":"0.1.123","library":"langchain-core","platform":"macOS-14.5-arm64-arm-64bit","runtime":"python","py_implementation":"CPython","runtime_version":"3.12.4","langchain_version":"0.3.0","langchain_core_version":"0.3.1","library_version":"0.3.1"}},"error":null,"events":[{"name":"start","time":"2024-09-19T17:47:40.278041+00:00"}],"reference_example_id":null,"parent_run_id":"e8f0ef86-def4-421b-b71e-78cf30aa2da8","tags":["graph:step:4"],"trace_id":"e8f0ef86-def4-421b-b71e-78cf30aa2da8","dotted_order":"20240919T174659869976Ze8f0ef86-def4-421b-b71e-78cf30aa2da8.20240919T174740278041Zef471c5a-90c6-492e-a40c-dc4e8c4c9035","outputs":null,"session_name":"default","name":"Coder","inputs":{"messages":[{"content":"Write

      Research Report on Pikas\n\n#### Introduction\nPikas are small, herbivorous
      mammals belonging to the family Ochotonidae within the order Lagomorpha, which
      also includes rabbits and hares. There are 30 recognized species of pikas, with
      the American pika (Ochotona princeps) and the collared pika (Ochotona collaris)
      being the two species found in North America. This report provides a comprehensive
      overview of pikas focusing on their habitat, diet, behavior, social structure,
      and conservation status.\n\n#### Habitat and Distribution\nPikas inhabit cold
      climates, predominantly found in alpine and subalpine regions. Their distribution
      spans across the mountainous areas of western North America, from central British
      Columbia and Alberta in Canada to various states in the USA, including Oregon,
      Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, and
      New Mexico.\n\nPikas thrive in rocky terrains, such as talus slopes and meadows
      rich in vegetation, which provide both shelter and food. These environments
      are typically characterized by cooler temperatures, which are crucial for the
      survival of pikas. They are highly sensitive to temperature increases and are
      often used as indicators for the effects of climate change.\n\n#### Diet and
      Feeding Habits\nPikas are generalist herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses,
      forbs, and small shrubs. They exhibit two primary foraging behaviors: direct
      consumption and caching of plants. The latter involves gathering and storing
      vegetation in \"haypiles\" to sustain them through the winter months when food

      pikas, for instance, show significant variation in their social complexity,
      with family groups demonstrating different social systems. Interactions within
      these groups can include cooperative behaviors as well as aggressive encounters,
      particularly among males from different families.\n\n#### Conservation Status\nThe
      conservation status of pikas varies among species. The American pika, in particular,
      faces threats from global climate change. They are highly susceptible to temperature
      increases, which can lead to habitat loss as they are forced to move to higher
      elevations in search of suitable conditions. Studies have documented declines
      in pika populations in regions like the Great Basin, where warmer and drier
      conditions prevail.\n\nDespite these challenges, the US government decided in
      2010 not to list the American pika under the Endangered Species Act. However,
      pikas remain a focal species for climate change research due to their sensitivity
      to environmental changes.\n\nEfforts to monitor and conserve pika populations
      include long-term studies and citizen science programs, which aim to track their
      distribution, behavior, and population trends. These initiatives are crucial
      for understanding the impacts of climate change and implementing effective conservation
      strategies.\n\n#### Conclusion\nPikas are fascinating small mammals with unique
      adaptations to cold alpine environments. Their behaviors, particularly their
      haying and social interactions, are integral to their survival. However, they
      face significant threats from climate change, which necessitates ongoing research

      Research Report on Pikas\n\n#### Introduction\nPikas are small, herbivorous
      mammals belonging to the family Ochotonidae within the order Lagomorpha, which
      also includes rabbits and hares. There are 30 recognized species of pikas, with
      the American pika (Ochotona princeps) and the collared pika (Ochotona collaris)
      being the two species found in North America. This report provides a comprehensive
      overview of pikas focusing on their habitat, diet, behavior, social structure,
      and conservation status.\n\n#### Habitat and Distribution\nPikas inhabit cold
      climates, predominantly found in alpine and subalpine regions. Their distribution
      spans across the mountainous areas of western North America, from central British
      Columbia and Alberta in Canada to various states in the USA, including Oregon,
      Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, and
      New Mexico.\n\nPikas thrive in rocky terrains, such as talus slopes and meadows
      rich in vegetation, which provide both shelter and food. These environments
      are typically characterized by cooler temperatures, which are crucial for the
      survival of pikas. They are highly sensitive to temperature increases and are
      often used as indicators for the effects of climate change.\n\n#### Diet and
      Feeding Habits\nPikas are generalist herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses,
      forbs, and small shrubs. They exhibit two primary foraging behaviors: direct
      consumption and caching of plants. The latter involves gathering and storing
      vegetation in \"haypiles\" to sustain them through the winter months when food
      is scarce.\n\nTheir diet is diverse, extending to various alpine meadow plants.
      During the summer, pikas actively collect and dry plant material, which they
      store in their dens or crevices between rocks. This \"haying\" behavior is critical
      for their winter survival, as they do not hibernate and rely on these stored
      food reserves.\n\n#### Behavior and Social Structure\nPikas are diurnal and
      exhibit a range of social behaviors. While some species are solitary, others,
      like the Eurasian pikas, live in family groups and share responsibilities such
      as gathering food and keeping watch for predators. The social structure of pikas
      can influence their foraging behavior and territory establishment.\n\nPlateau
      pikas, for instance, show significant variation in their social complexity,
      with family groups demonstrating different social systems. Interactions within
      these groups can include cooperative behaviors as well as aggressive encounters,
      particularly among males from different families.\n\n#### Conservation Status\nThe
      conservation status of pikas varies among species. The American pika, in particular,
      faces threats from global climate change. They are highly susceptible to temperature
      increases, which can lead to habitat loss as they are forced to move to higher
      elevations in search of suitable conditions. Studies have documented declines

      these groups can include cooperative behaviors as well as aggressive encounters,
      particularly among males from different families.\n\n#### Conservation Status\nThe
      conservation status of pikas varies among species. The American pika, in particular,
      faces threats from global climate change. They are highly susceptible to temperature
      increases, which can lead to habitat loss as they are forced to move to higher
      elevations in search of suitable conditions. Studies have documented declines
      in pika populations in regions like the Great Basin, where warmer and drier
      conditions prevail.\n\nDespite these challenges, the US government decided in
      2010 not to list the American pika under the Endangered Species Act. However,
      pikas remain a focal species for climate change research due to their sensitivity
      to environmental changes.\n\nEfforts to monitor and conserve pika populations
      include long-term studies and citizen science programs, which aim to track their
      distribution, behavior, and population trends. These initiatives are crucial
      for understanding the impacts of climate change and implementing effective conservation
      strategies.\n\n#### Conclusion\nPikas are fascinating small mammals with unique
      adaptations to cold alpine environments. Their behaviors, particularly their
      haying and social interactions, are integral to their survival. However, they
      face significant threats from climate change, which necessitates ongoing research
      and conservation efforts to ensure their persistence in a rapidly changing world.","additional_kwargs":{},"response_metadata":{},"type":"human","name":"Researcher","id":"ee305a9e-8b8c-41b1-8853-83943bc1a61a","example":false}],"next":"Researcher"},"outputs":{"output":{"next":"Coder"}},"events":[{"name":"end","time":"2024-09-19T17:47:40.277278+00:00"}]},{"id":"2c61b409-5951-4d64-9270-bf1b8c98e096","name":"RunnableSequence","trace_id":"e8f0ef86-def4-421b-b71e-78cf30aa2da8","parent_run_id":"687339cb-1764-45f6-a600-399b9aa78bea","dotted_order":"20240919T174659869976Ze8f0ef86-def4-421b-b71e-78cf30aa2da8.20240919T174739437563Z687339cb-1764-45f6-a600-399b9aa78bea.20240919T174739440212Z2c61b409-5951-4d64-9270-bf1b8c98e096","tags":["seq:step:1"],"extra":{"metadata":{"langgraph_step":3,"langgraph_node":"supervisor","langgraph_triggers":["Researcher"],"langgraph_path":["__pregel_pull","supervisor"],"langgraph_checkpoint_ns":"supervisor:8c10e848-b61a-1924-be12-cc71e22c691a","checkpoint_ns":"supervisor:8c10e848-b61a-1924-be12-cc71e22c691a","revision_id":"checkpoint==1.0.10-68-g22fa527b-dirty"},"runtime":{"sdk":"langsmith-py","sdk_version":"0.1.123","library":"langsmith","platform":"macOS-14.5-arm64-arm-64bit","runtime":"python","py_implementation":"CPython","runtime_version":"3.12.4","langchain_version":"0.3.0","langchain_core_version":"0.3.1"}},"end_time":"2024-09-19T17:47:40.275435+00:00","inputs":{"messages":[{"content":"Write

      Research Report on Pikas\n\n#### Introduction\nPikas are small, herbivorous
      mammals belonging to the family Ochotonidae within the order Lagomorpha, which
      also includes rabbits and hares. There are 30 recognized species of pikas, with
      the American pika (Ochotona princeps) and the collared pika (Ochotona collaris)
      being the two species found in North America. This report provides a comprehensive
      overview of pikas focusing on their habitat, diet, behavior, social structure,
      and conservation status.\n\n#### Habitat and Distribution\nPikas inhabit cold
      climates, predominantly found in alpine and subalpine regions. Their distribution
      spans across the mountainous areas of western North America, from central British
      Columbia and Alberta in Canada to various states in the USA, including Oregon,
      Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, and
      New Mexico.\n\nPikas thrive in rocky terrains, such as talus slopes and meadows
      rich in vegetation, which provide both shelter and food. These environments
      are typically characterized by cooler temperatures, which are crucial for the
      survival of pikas. They are highly sensitive to temperature increases and are
      often used as indicators for the effects of climate change.\n\n#### Diet and
      Feeding Habits\nPikas are generalist herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses,
      forbs, and small shrubs. They exhibit two primary foraging behaviors: direct
      consumption and caching of plants. The latter involves gathering and storing
      vegetation in \"haypiles\" to sustain them through the winter months when food
      is scarce.\n\nTheir diet is diverse, extending to various alpine meadow plants.
      During the summer, pikas actively collect and dry plant material, which they
      store in their dens or crevices between rocks. This \"haying\" behavior is critical
      for their winter survival, as they do not hibernate and rely on these stored
      food reserves.\n\n#### Behavior and Social Structure\nPikas are diurnal and
      exhibit a range of social behaviors. While some species are solitary, others,
      like the Eurasian pikas, live in family groups and share responsibilities such
      as gathering food and keeping watch for predators. The social structure of pikas
      can influence their foraging behavior and territory establishment.\n\nPlateau
      pikas, for instance, show significant variation in their social complexity,
      with family groups demonstrating different social systems. Interactions within
      these groups can include cooperative behaviors as well as aggressive encounters,
      particularly among males from different families.\n\n#### Conservation Status\nThe
      conservation status of pikas varies among species. The American pika, in particular,

      Research Report on Pikas\n\n#### Introduction\nPikas are small, herbivorous
      mammals belonging to the family Ochotonidae within the order Lagomorpha, which
      also includes rabbits and hares. There are 30 recognized species of pikas, with
      the American pika (Ochotona princeps) and the collared pika (Ochotona collaris)
      being the two species found in North America. This report provides a comprehensive
      overview of pikas focusing on their habitat, diet, behavior, social structure,
      and conservation status.\n\n#### Habitat and Distribution\nPikas inhabit cold
      climates, predominantly found in alpine and subalpine regions. Their distribution
      spans across the mountainous areas of western North America, from central British
      Columbia and Alberta in Canada to various states in the USA, including Oregon,
      Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, and
      New Mexico.\n\nPikas thrive in rocky terrains, such as talus slopes and meadows
      rich in vegetation, which provide both shelter and food. These environments
      are typically characterized by cooler temperatures, which are crucial for the
      survival of pikas. They are highly sensitive to temperature increases and are
      often used as indicators for the effects of climate change.\n\n#### Diet and
      Feeding Habits\nPikas are generalist herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses,
      forbs, and small shrubs. They exhibit two primary foraging behaviors: direct
      consumption and caching of plants. The latter involves gathering and storing
      vegetation in \"haypiles\" to sustain them through the winter months when food
      is scarce.\n\nTheir diet is diverse, extending to various alpine meadow plants.
      During the summer, pikas actively collect and dry plant material, which they
      store in their dens or crevices between rocks. This \"haying\" behavior is critical
      for their winter survival, as they do not hibernate and rely on these stored
      food reserves.\n\n#### Behavior and Social Structure\nPikas are diurnal and
      exhibit a range of social behaviors. While some species are solitary, others,
      like the Eurasian pikas, live in family groups and share responsibilities such
      as gathering food and keeping watch for predators. The social structure of pikas
      can influence their foraging behavior and territory establishment.\n\nPlateau
      pikas, for instance, show significant variation in their social complexity,
      with family groups demonstrating different social systems. Interactions within
      these groups can include cooperative behaviors as well as aggressive encounters,
      particularly among males from different families.\n\n#### Conservation Status\nThe
      conservation status of pikas varies among species. The American pika, in particular,
      faces threats from global climate change. They are highly susceptible to temperature
      increases, which can lead to habitat loss as they are forced to move to higher
      elevations in search of suitable conditions. Studies have documented declines
      in pika populations in regions like the Great Basin, where warmer and drier
      conditions prevail.\n\nDespite these challenges, the US government decided in
      2010 not to list the American pika under the Endangered Species Act. However,
      pikas remain a focal species for climate change research due to their sensitivity
      to environmental changes.\n\nEfforts to monitor and conserve pika populations
      include long-term studies and citizen science programs, which aim to track their
      distribution, behavior, and population trends. These initiatives are crucial
      for understanding the impacts of climate change and implementing effective conservation
      strategies.\n\n#### Conclusion\nPikas are fascinating small mammals with unique
      adaptations to cold alpine environments. Their behaviors, particularly their
      haying and social interactions, are integral to their survival. However, they
      face significant threats from climate change, which necessitates ongoing research
      and conservation efforts to ensure their persistence in a rapidly changing world.\n\n---\n\nThis

      often used as indicators for the effects of climate change.\n\n#### Diet and
      Feeding Habits\nPikas are generalist herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses,
      forbs, and small shrubs. They exhibit two primary foraging behaviors: direct
      consumption and caching of plants. The latter involves gathering and storing
      vegetation in \"haypiles\" to sustain them through the winter months when food
      is scarce.\n\nTheir diet is diverse, extending to various alpine meadow plants.
      During the summer, pikas actively collect and dry plant material, which they
      store in their dens or crevices between rocks. This \"haying\" behavior is critical
      for their winter survival, as they do not hibernate and rely on these stored
      food reserves.\n\n#### Behavior and Social Structure\nPikas are diurnal and
      exhibit a range of social behaviors. While some species are solitary, others,
      like the Eurasian pikas, live in family groups and share responsibilities such
      as gathering food and keeping watch for predators. The social structure of pikas
      can influence their foraging behavior and territory establishment.\n\nPlateau
      pikas, for instance, show significant variation in their social complexity,
      with family groups demonstrating different social systems. Interactions within
      these groups can include cooperative behaviors as well as aggressive encounters,
      particularly among males from different families.\n\n#### Conservation Status\nThe
      conservation status of pikas varies among species. The American pika, in particular,
      faces threats from global climate change. They are highly susceptible to temperature
      increases, which can lead to habitat loss as they are forced to move to higher
      elevations in search of suitable conditions. Studies have documented declines
      in pika populations in regions like the Great Basin, where warmer and drier
      conditions prevail.\n\nDespite these challenges, the US government decided in
      2010 not to list the American pika under the Endangered Species Act. However,
      pikas remain a focal species for climate change research due to their sensitivity
      to environmental changes.\n\nEfforts to monitor and conserve pika populations
      include long-term studies and citizen science programs, which aim to track their
      distribution, behavior, and population trends. These initiatives are crucial
      for understanding the impacts of climate change and implementing effective conservation
      strategies.\n\n#### Conclusion\nPikas are fascinating small mammals with unique
      adaptations to cold alpine environments. Their behaviors, particularly their
      haying and social interactions, are integral to their survival. However, they
      face significant threats from climate change, which necessitates ongoing research
      and conservation efforts to ensure their persistence in a rapidly changing world.\n\n---\n\nThis

      Research Report on Pikas\n\n#### Introduction\nPikas are small, herbivorous
      mammals belonging to the family Ochotonidae within the order Lagomorpha, which
      also includes rabbits and hares. There are 30 recognized species of pikas, with
      the American pika (Ochotona princeps) and the collared pika (Ochotona collaris)
      being the two species found in North America. This report provides a comprehensive
      overview of pikas focusing on their habitat, diet, behavior, social structure,
      and conservation status.\n\n#### Habitat and Distribution\nPikas inhabit cold
      climates, predominantly found in alpine and subalpine regions. Their distribution
      spans across the mountainous areas of western North America, from central British
      Columbia and Alberta in Canada to various states in the USA, including Oregon,
      Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, and
      New Mexico.\n\nPikas thrive in rocky terrains, such as talus slopes and meadows
      rich in vegetation, which provide both shelter and food. These environments
      are typically characterized by cooler temperatures, which are crucial for the

      Research Report on Pikas\n\n#### Introduction\nPikas are small, herbivorous
      mammals belonging to the family Ochotonidae within the order Lagomorpha, which
      also includes rabbits and hares. There are 30 recognized species of pikas, with
      the American pika (Ochotona princeps) and the collared pika (Ochotona collaris)
      being the two species found in North America. This report provides a comprehensive
      overview of pikas focusing on their habitat, diet, behavior, social structure,
      and conservation status.\n\n#### Habitat and Distribution\nPikas inhabit cold
      climates, predominantly found in alpine and subalpine regions. Their distribution
      spans across the mountainous areas of western North America, from central British
      Columbia and Alberta in Canada to various states in the USA, including Oregon,
      Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, and
      New Mexico.\n\nPikas thrive in rocky terrains, such as talus slopes and meadows
      rich in vegetation, which provide both shelter and food. These environments
      are typically characterized by cooler temperatures, which are crucial for the
      survival of pikas. They are highly sensitive to temperature increases and are
      often used as indicators for the effects of climate change.\n\n#### Diet and
      Feeding Habits\nPikas are generalist herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses,
      forbs, and small shrubs. They exhibit two primary foraging behaviors: direct
      consumption and caching of plants. The latter involves gathering and storing
      vegetation in \"haypiles\" to sustain them through the winter months when food
      is scarce.\n\nTheir diet is diverse, extending to various alpine meadow plants.
      During the summer, pikas actively collect and dry plant material, which they
      store in their dens or crevices between rocks. This \"haying\" behavior is critical
      for their winter survival, as they do not hibernate and rely on these stored
      food reserves.\n\n#### Behavior and Social Structure\nPikas are diurnal and
      exhibit a range of social behaviors. While some species are solitary, others,
      like the Eurasian pikas, live in family groups and share responsibilities such
      as gathering food and keeping watch for predators. The social structure of pikas
      can influence their foraging behavior and territory establishment.\n\nPlateau
      pikas, for instance, show significant variation in their social complexity,
      with family groups demonstrating different social systems. Interactions within
      these groups can include cooperative behaviors as well as aggressive encounters,
      particularly among males from different families.\n\n#### Conservation Status\nThe
      conservation status of pikas varies among species. The American pika, in particular,
      faces threats from global climate change. They are highly susceptible to temperature
      increases, which can lead to habitat loss as they are forced to move to higher
      elevations in search of suitable conditions. Studies have documented declines
      in pika populations in regions like the Great Basin, where warmer and drier
      conditions prevail.\n\nDespite these challenges, the US government decided in
      2010 not to list the American pika under the Endangered Species Act. However,
      pikas remain a focal species for climate change research due to their sensitivity
      to environmental changes.\n\nEfforts to monitor and conserve pika populations
      include long-term studies and citizen science programs, which aim to track their
      distribution, behavior, and population trends. These initiatives are crucial
      for understanding the impacts of climate change and implementing effective conservation
      strategies.\n\n#### Conclusion\nPikas are fascinating small mammals with unique
      adaptations to cold alpine environments. Their behaviors, particularly their
      haying and social interactions, are integral to their survival. However, they
      face significant threats from climate change, which necessitates ongoing research
      and conservation efforts to ensure their persistence in a rapidly changing world.","additional_kwargs":{},"response_metadata":{},"type":"human","name":"Researcher","id":"ee305a9e-8b8c-41b1-8853-83943bc1a61a"},{"content":"###

      Research Report on Pikas\n\n#### Introduction\nPikas are small, herbivorous
      mammals belonging to the family Ochotonidae within the order Lagomorpha, which
      also includes rabbits and hares. There are 30 recognized species of pikas, with
      the American pika (Ochotona princeps) and the collared pika (Ochotona collaris)
      being the two species found in North America. This report provides a comprehensive
      overview of pikas focusing on their habitat, diet, behavior, social structure,
      and conservation status.\n\n#### Habitat and Distribution\nPikas inhabit cold
      climates, predominantly found in alpine and subalpine regions. Their distribution
      spans across the mountainous areas of western North America, from central British
      Columbia and Alberta in Canada to various states in the USA, including Oregon,
      Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, and
      New Mexico.\n\nPikas thrive in rocky terrains, such as talus slopes and meadows
      rich in vegetation, which provide both shelter and food. These environments
      are typically characterized by cooler temperatures, which are crucial for the
      survival of pikas. They are highly sensitive to temperature increases and are
      often used as indicators for the effects of climate change.\n\n#### Diet and
      Feeding Habits\nPikas are generalist herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses,
      forbs, and small shrubs. They exhibit two primary foraging behaviors: direct
      consumption and caching of plants. The latter involves gathering and storing
      vegetation in \"haypiles\" to sustain them through the winter months when food
      is scarce.\n\nTheir diet is diverse, extending to various alpine meadow plants.
      During the summer, pikas actively collect and dry plant material, which they
      store in their dens or crevices between rocks. This \"haying\" behavior is critical
      for their winter survival, as they do not hibernate and rely on these stored
      food reserves.\n\n#### Behavior and Social Structure\nPikas are diurnal and
      exhibit a range of social behaviors. While some species are solitary, others,
      like the Eurasian pikas, live in family groups and share responsibilities such
      as gathering food and keeping watch for predators. The social structure of pikas
      can influence their foraging behavior and territory establishment.\n\nPlateau
      pikas, for instance, show significant variation in their social complexity,
      with family groups demonstrating different social systems. Interactions within
      these groups can include cooperative behaviors as well as aggressive encounters,

      survival of pikas. They are highly sensitive to temperature increases and are
      often used as indicators for the effects of climate change.\n\n#### Diet and
      Feeding Habits\nPikas are generalist herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses,
      forbs, and small shrubs. They exhibit two primary foraging behaviors: direct
      consumption and caching of plants. The latter involves gathering and storing
      vegetation in \"haypiles\" to sustain them through the winter months when food
      is scarce.\n\nTheir diet is diverse, extending to various alpine meadow plants.
      During the summer, pikas actively collect and dry plant material, which they
      store in their dens or crevices between rocks. This \"haying\" behavior is critical
      for their winter survival, as they do not hibernate and rely on these stored
      food reserves.\n\n#### Behavior and Social Structure\nPikas are diurnal and
      exhibit a range of social behaviors. While some species are solitary, others,
      like the Eurasian pikas, live in family groups and share responsibilities such
      as gathering food and keeping watch for predators. The social structure of pikas
      can influence their foraging behavior and territory establishment.\n\nPlateau
      pikas, for instance, show significant variation in their social complexity,
      with family groups demonstrating different social systems. Interactions within
      these groups can include cooperative behaviors as well as aggressive encounters,
      particularly among males from different families.\n\n#### Conservation Status\nThe
      conservation status of pikas varies among species. The American pika, in particular,
      faces threats from global climate change. They are highly susceptible to temperature
      increases, which can lead to habitat loss as they are forced to move to higher
      elevations in search of suitable conditions. Studies have documented declines
      in pika populations in regions like the Great Basin, where warmer and drier
      conditions prevail.\n\nDespite these challenges, the US government decided in
      2010 not to list the American pika under the Endangered Species Act. However,
      pikas remain a focal species for climate change research due to their sensitivity
      to environmental changes.\n\nEfforts to monitor and conserve pika populations
      include long-term studies and citizen science programs, which aim to track their
      distribution, behavior, and population trends. These initiatives are crucial
      for understanding the impacts of climate change and implementing effective conservation
      strategies.\n\n#### Conclusion\nPikas are fascinating small mammals with unique
      adaptations to cold alpine environments. Their behaviors, particularly their
      haying and social interactions, are integral to their survival. However, they
      face significant threats from climate change, which necessitates ongoing research
      and conservation efforts to ensure their persistence in a rapidly changing world.\n\n---\n\nThis

      Research Report on Pikas\n\n#### Introduction\nPikas are small, herbivorous
      mammals belonging to the family Ochotonidae within the order Lagomorpha, which
      also includes rabbits and hares. There are 30 recognized species of pikas, with
      the American pika (Ochotona princeps) and the collared pika (Ochotona collaris)
      being the two species found in North America. This report provides a comprehensive

      climates, predominantly found in alpine and subalpine regions. Their distribution
      spans across the mountainous areas of western North America, from central British
      Columbia and Alberta in Canada to various states in the USA, including Oregon,
      Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, and
      New Mexico.\n\nPikas thrive in rocky terrains, such as talus slopes and meadows
      rich in vegetation, which provide both shelter and food. These environments

      Research Report on Pikas\n\n#### Introduction\nPikas are small, herbivorous
      mammals belonging to the family Ochotonidae within the order Lagomorpha, which
      also includes rabbits and hares. There are 30 recognized species of pikas, with
      the American pika (Ochotona princeps) and the collared pika (Ochotona collaris)
      being the two species found in North America. This report provides a comprehensive
      overview of pikas focusing on their habitat, diet, behavior, social structure,
      and conservation status.\n\n#### Habitat and Distribution\nPikas inhabit cold
      climates, predominantly found in alpine and subalpine regions. Their distribution
      spans across the mountainous areas of western North America, from central British
      Columbia and Alberta in Canada to various states in the USA, including Oregon,
      Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, and
      New Mexico.\n\nPikas thrive in rocky terrains, such as talus slopes and meadows
      rich in vegetation, which provide both shelter and food. These environments
      are typically characterized by cooler temperatures, which are crucial for the
      survival of pikas. They are highly sensitive to temperature increases and are
      often used as indicators for the effects of climate change.\n\n#### Diet and
      Feeding Habits\nPikas are generalist herbivores, primarily feeding on grasses,
      forbs, and small shrubs. They exhibit two primary foraging behaviors: direct
      consumption and caching of plants. The latter involves gathering and storing
      vegetation in \"haypiles\" to sustain them through the winter months when food
      is scarce.\n\nTheir diet is diverse, extending to various alpine meadow plants.
      During the summer, pikas actively collect and dry plant material, which they
      store in their dens or crevices between rocks. This \"haying\" behavior is critical
      for their winter survival, as they do not hibernate and rely on these stored
      food reserves.\n\n#### Behavior and Social Structure\nPikas are diurnal and
      exhibit a range of social behaviors. While some species are solitary, others,
      like the Eurasian pikas, live in family groups and share responsibilities such
      as gathering food and keeping watch for predators. The social structure of pikas
      can influence their foraging behavior and territory establishment.\n\nPlateau
      pikas, for instance, show significant variation in their social complexity,
      with family groups demonstrating different social systems. Interactions within
      these groups can include cooperative behaviors as well as aggressive encounters,
      particularly among males from different families.\n\n#### Conservation Status\nThe
      conservation status of pikas varies among species. The American pika, in particular,
      faces threats from global climate change. They are highly susceptible to temperature
      increases, which can lead to habitat loss as they are forced to move to higher
      elevations in search of suitable conditions. Studies have documented declines
      in pika populations in regions like the Great Basin, where warmer and drier
      conditions prevail.\n\nDespite these challenges, the US government decided in
      2010 not to list the American pika under the Endangered Species Act. However,
      pikas remain a focal species for climate change research due to their sensitivity
      to environmental changes.\n\nEfforts to monitor and conserve pika populations
      include long-term studies and citizen science programs, which aim to track their
      distribution, behavior, and population trends. These initiatives are crucial
      for understanding the impacts of climate change and implementing effective conservation
      strategies.\n\n#### Conclusion\nPikas are fascinating small mammals with unique
      adaptations to cold alpine environments. Their behaviors, particularly their
      haying and social interactions, are integral to their survival. However, they
      face significant threats from climate change, which necessitates ongoing research
      and conservation efforts to ensure their persistence in a rapidly changing world.","additional_kwargs":{},"response_metadata":{},"type":"human","name":"Researcher","id":"ee305a9e-8b8c-41b1-8853-83943bc1a61a","example":false}],"is_last_step":false},"outputs":{"output":{"content":"###

      are small, herbivorous mammals belonging to the family Ochotonidae within the
      order Lagomorpha, which also includes rabbits and hares. There are 30 recognized
      species of pikas, with the American pika (Ochotona princeps) and the collared
      pika (Ochotona collaris) being the two species found in North America. This
      report provides a comprehensive overview of pikas focusing on their habitat,
      diet, behavior, social structure, and conservation status.\n\n#### Habitat and
      Distribution\nPikas inhabit cold climates, predominantly found in alpine and
      subalpine regions. Their distribution spans across the mountainous areas of
      western North America, from central British Columbia and Alberta in Canada to
      various states in the USA, including Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming,
      Colorado, Utah, Nevada, California, and New Mexico.\n\nPikas thrive in rocky
      terrains, such as talus slopes and meadows rich in vegetation, which provide
      both shelter and food. These environments are typically characterized by cooler
      temperatures, which are crucial for the survival of pikas. They are highly sensitive
      to temperature increases and are often used as indicators for the effects of
      climate change.\n\n#### Diet and Feeding Habits\nPikas are generalist herbivores,
      primarily feeding on grasses, forbs, and small shrubs. They exhibit two primary
      foraging behaviors: direct consumption and caching of plants. The latter involves
      gathering and storing vegetation in \"haypiles\" to sustain them through the
      winter months when food is scarce.\n\nTheir diet is diverse, extending to various
      alpine meadow plants. During the summer, pikas actively collect and dry plant
      material, which they store in their dens or crevices between rocks. This \"haying\"
      behavior is critical for their winter survival, as they do not hibernate and
      rely on these stored food reserves.\n\n#### Behavior and Social Structure\nPikas
      are diurnal and exhibit a range of social behaviors. While some species are
      solitary, others, like the Eurasian pikas, live in family groups and share responsibilities
      such as gathering food and keeping watch for predators. The social structure
      of pikas can influence their foraging behavior and territory establishment.\n\nPlateau
      pikas, for instance, show significant variation in their social complexity,
      with family groups demonstrating different social systems. Interactions within
      these groups can include cooperative behaviors as well as aggressive encounters,
      particularly among males from different families.\n\n#### Conservation Status\nThe
      conservation status of pikas varies among species. The American pika, in particular,
      faces threats from global climate change. They are highly susceptible to temperature
      increases, which can lead to habitat loss as they are forced to move to higher
      elevations in search of suitable conditions. Studies have documented declines
      in pika populations in regions like the Great Basin, where warmer and drier
      conditions prevail.\n\nDespite these challenges, the US government decided in
      2010 not to list the American pika under the Endangered Species Act. However,
      pikas remain a focal species for climate change research due to their sensitivity
      to environmental changes.\n\nEfforts to monitor and conserve pika populations
      include long-term studies and citizen science programs, which aim to track their
      distribution, behavior, and population trends. These initiatives are crucial
      for understanding the impacts of climate change and implementing effective conservation
      strategies.\n\n#### Conclusion\nPikas are fascinating small mammals with unique
      adaptations to cold alpine environments. Their behaviors, particularly their
      haying and social interactions, are integral to their survival. However, they
      face significant threats from climate change, which necessitates ongoing research
