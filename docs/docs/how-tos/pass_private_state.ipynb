    "# How to pass private state between nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Oftentimes, you may want nodes to be able to pass state to each other that should NOT be part of the main schema of the graph. This is often useful because there may be information that is not needed as input/output (and therefore doesn't really make sense to have in the main schema) but is ABSOLUTELY needed as part of the intermediate working logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will have a separate node for each step. We will only have the `question` and `answer` on the overall state. However, we will need separate states for the `search_query` and the `documents` - we will pass these as private state keys. See the conceptual docs [here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/low_level/#multiple-schemas) for more details.\n",
