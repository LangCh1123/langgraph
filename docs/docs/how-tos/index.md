# How-To Guides

Welcome to the LangGraph How-To Guides! These guides provide practical, step-by-step instructions for accomplishing key tasks in LangGraph.

## Core

- [Persistence](persistence.ipynb): How to give your graph "memory" and resiliance by saving and loading state
- [Time Travel](time-travel.ipynb): How to navigate and manipulate graph state history
- [Async Execution](async.ipynb): How to run nodes asynchronously for improved performance
- [Streaming Responses](streaming-tokens.ipynb): How to stream agent responses in real-time
- [Human-in-the-Loop](human-in-the-loop.ipynb): How to incorporate human feedback and intervention
- [Visualization](visualization.ipynb): How to visualize your graphs
- [Subgraphs](subgraph.ipynb): How to compose subgraphs within a larger graph
- [Branching](branching.ipynb): How to create branching logic in your graphs
- [Pydantic State](state-model.ipynb): Use a pydantic model as your state



# TODO
Update the above ^ 
Update this:
- [Dynamic Direct Return](chat_agent_executor_with_function_calling/dynamically-returning-directly.ipynb)

Add these:

- Force tool first
- Respond in format
- Manage Agent Steps
