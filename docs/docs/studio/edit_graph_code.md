# How to edit graph code

LangGraph Studio allows you to modify your graph code and sync the changes live to the interactive graph.

To modify your graph from the studio, follow these steps:

1. Click `Open in VS Code` on the bottom right. This will open the project that is currently opened in LangGraph studio.
1. Make changes to the `.py` files where the compiled graph is defined or associated dependencies.
1. LangGraph studio will automatically reload once the changes are saved in the project directory.

The following video shows how to open code editor from the studio:
