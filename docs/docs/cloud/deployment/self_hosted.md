!!! warning "Enterprise License Required"
    Self-hosting LangGraph Cloud API requires a license key. Please contact sales@langchain.dev for more details.

LangGraph Cloud APIs can be self-hosted with a valid LangGraph Cloud license key. Self-hosted deployments are built with Docker and deployed with Helm (on Kubernetes) or with Docker Compose. Ensure that the [Docker CLI](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/) is installed.

## Build Image

1. Follow the [How-to Guide](setup.md) for setting up a LangGraph application for deployment.
1. Install the [LangGraph CLI](../reference/cli.md#installation).
1. Run the following LangGraph CLI `build` command to build a Docker image. Specify the image tag (`-t`) and other desired [options](../reference/cli.md#build).

        langgraph build -t tag_name
