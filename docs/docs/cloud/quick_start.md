# Quick Start
This quick start guide will cover how to build a simple chatbot with LangGraph, deploy it to LangGraph Cloud, use the LangGraph Studio to visualize and test it out, and use the LangGraph Cloud SDK to interact with it.


## Set up local files

1. Create a new application with the following directory and files:

        <my-app>/
        |-- agent.py            # code for your LangGraph agent
        |-- requirements.txt    # Python packages required for your graph
        |-- langgraph.json      # configuration file for LangGraph
        |-- .env                # environment files with API keys

2. The `agent.py` file should contain Python code for defining your graph. The following code is a simple example, the important thing is that at some point in your file you compile your graph and assign the compiled graph to a variable (in this case the `graph` variable). 

    ```python
   from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
   from langgraph.graph import END, StateGraph, MessagesState
   
   model = ChatAnthropic(model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620")
   
   graph_workflow = StateGraph(MessagesState)
   
   
   def agent(state: MessagesState):
       response = model.invoke(state["messages"])
       return {"messages": [response]}
   
   
   graph_workflow.add_node(agent)
   graph_workflow.add_edge("agent", END)
   graph_workflow.set_entry_point("agent")
   
   graph = graph_workflow.compile()
    ```

3. The `requirements.txt` file should contain any dependencies for your graph(s). In this case we only require two packages for our graph to run:

        langgraph
        langchain_anthropic

4. The `langgraph.json` file is a configuration file that describes what graph(s) you are going to host. In this case we only have one graph to host: the compiled `graph` object from `agent.py`.

    ```json
    {
        "dependencies": ["."],
        "graphs": {
            "agent": "./agent.py:graph"
        },
        "env": ".env"
    }
    ```

    Learn more about the LangGraph CLI configuration file [here](./reference/cli.md#configuration-file).

Now that we have set everything up on our local file system, we are ready to host our graph. 

## Deploy to Cloud

### Push your code to GitHub

Turn the `<my-app>` directory into a GitHub repo. You can use the GitHub CLI if you like, or just create a repo manually (if unfamiliar, instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github)).

### Deploy from GitHub with LangGraph Cloud

Once you have created your github repository with a Python file containing your compiled graph as well as a `langgraph.json` file containing the configuration for hosting your graph, you can head over to LangSmith and click on the ðŸš€Â icon on the left navbar to create a new deployment. Then click the `+ New Deployment` button. 

![Langsmith Workflow](./img/cloud_deployment.png)

***If you have not deployed to LangGraph Cloud before:*** there will be a button that shows up saying Import from GitHub. Youâ€™ll need to follow that flow to connect LangGraph Cloud to GitHub.

***Once you have set up your GitHub connection:*** the new deployment page will look as follows:

![Deployment before being filled out](./deployment/img/deployment_page.png)

To deploy your application, you should do the following:

1. Select your GitHub username or organization from the selector
2. Search for your repo to deploy in the search bar and select it
3. Choose any name
4. In the `LangGraph API config file` field, enter the path to your `langgraph.json` file (if left blank langsmith will automatically search for it on deployment)
5. For Git Reference, you can select either the git branch for the code you want to deploy, or the exact commit SHA. 
6. If your chain relies on environment variables (for example, an OPENAI_API_KEY), add those in. They will be propagated to the underlying server so your code can access them.

Putting this all together, you should have something as follows for your deployment details:

![Deployment filled out](./deployment/img/deploy_filled_out.png)

Hit `Submit` and your application will start deploying!

## Inspect Traces + Monitor Service

### Deployments View

After your deployment is complete, your deployments page should look as follows:

![Deployed page](./deployment/img/deployed_page.png)

You can see that by default, you get access to the `Trace Count` monitoring chart and `Recent Traces` run view. These are powered by LangSmith. 

You can click on `All Charts` to view all monitoring info for your server, or click on `See tracing project` to get more information on an individual trace.

### Access the Docs

You can access the docs by clicking on the API docs link, which should send you to a page that looks like this:

![API Docs page](./deployment/img/api_page.png)

You wonâ€™t actually be able to test any of the API endpoints without authorizing first. To do so, click on the Authorize button in the top right corner, input your `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`  in the `API Key` box, and then click `Authorize` to finish the process. You should now be able to select any of the API endpoints, click `Try it out`, enter the parameters you would like to pass, and then click `Execute` to view the results of the API call.

## Interact with your deployment via LangGraph Studio

If you click on your deployment you should see a blue button in the top right that says `LangGraph Studio`. Clicking on this button will take you to a page that looks like this:

![Studio UI before being run](./deployment/img/graph_visualization.png)

On this page you can test out your graph by passing in starting states and clicking `Start Run` (this should behave identically to calling `.invoke`). You will then be able to look into the execution thread for each run and explore the steps your graph is taking to produce its output.

![Studio UI once being run](./deployment/img/graph_run.png)

## Use with the SDK

Once you have tested that your hosted graph works as expected using LangGraph Studio, you can start using your hosted graph all over your organization by using the LangGraph SDK. Let's see how we can access our hosted graph and execute our run from a python file. 

First, make sure you have the SDK installed by calling `pip install langgraph_sdk`.

Before using, you need to get the URL of your LangGraph deployment. You can find this on the auto generated documentation page here:

![Base URL of LangGraph deployment](./deployment/img/base_url.png)

You also need to make sure you have set up your API key properly so you can authenticate with LangGraph Cloud.

```shell
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=...
```

The first thing to do when using the SDK is to setup our client, access our assistant, and create a thread to execute a run on:

```python
from langgraph_sdk import get_client

# Replace this with the URL of your own deployed graph
URL = "https://chatbot-23a570f3210f52a7b167f09f6158e3b3-ffoprvkqsa-uc.a.run.app"
client = get_client(url=URL)

# Search all hosted graphs
assistants = await client.assistants.search()
# In this example we select the first assistant since we are only hosting a single graph
assistant = assistants[0]

# We create a thread for tracking the state of our run
thread = await client.threads.create()
```

We can then execute a run on the thread:

```python
input = {"messages":[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello! My name is Bagatur and I am 26 years old."}]}

async for chunk in client.runs.stream(
        thread['thread_id'],
        assistant["assistant_id"],
        input=input,
        stream_mode="updates",
    ):
    if chunk.data and "run_id" not in chunk.data:
            print(chunk.data)
```

    {'agent': {'messages': [{'content': "Hi Bagatur! It's nice to meet you. How can I assist you today?", 'additional_kwargs': {}, 'response_metadata': {'finish_reason': 'stop', 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-05-13', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_9cb5d38cf7'}, 'type': 'ai', 'name': None, 'id': 'run-c89118b7-1b1e-42b9-a85d-c43fe99881cd', 'example': False, 'tool_calls': [], 'invalid_tool_calls': [], 'usage_metadata': None}]}}
