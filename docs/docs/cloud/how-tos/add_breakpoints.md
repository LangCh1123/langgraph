# Adding breakpoints

In the LangGraph studio it is easy to add breakpoints to your graph so you can dive deeper into how your graph is working. Adding a breakpoint is very simple, all you have to do is click on the Spider icon in the top right and select which nodes you want the graph to stop after. When the graph finishes that node, you will need to click the continue button shown in the right hand pane to continue the graph run. The following GIF shows this workflow in action:
